                               ARGUMENT

To Laius, King of Thebes, an oracle foretold that the child born to him
by his queen Jocasta would slay his father and wed his mother. So when
in time a son was born the infant's feet were riveted together and he
was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and
tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his
master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy,
who grew up believing that he was indeed the King's son. Afterwards
doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself
the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he
deemed his father's house and in his flight he encountered and
unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the
riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king.
So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen.
Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but
again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was
consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus
denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out
the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man.
The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus
blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.

                           OEDIPUS THE KING



Suppliants of all ages are seated round the altar at the palace doors,
at their head a PRIEST OF ZEUS.  To them enter OEDIPUS.

OEDIPUS
My children, latest born to Cadmus old,
Why sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands
Branches of olive filleted with wool?
What means this reek of incense everywhere,
And everywhere laments and litanies?
Children, it were not meet that I should learn
From others, and am hither come, myself,
I Oedipus, your world-renowned king.
Ho! aged sire, whose venerable locks
Proclaim thee spokesman of this company,
Explain your mood and purport.  Is it dread
Of ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?
My zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;
Ruthless indeed were I and obdurate
If such petitioners as you I spurned.

PRIEST
Yea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,
Thou seest how both extremes of age besiege
Thy palace altars--fledglings hardly winged,
and greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I
of Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.
Meanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs
Crowd our two market-places, or before
Both shrines of Pallas congregate, or where
Ismenus gives his oracles by fire.
For, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,
Sore buffeted, can no more lift her head,
Foundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.
A blight is on our harvest in the ear,
A blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,
A blight on wives in travail; and withal
Armed with his blazing torch the God of Plague
Hath swooped upon our city emptying
The house of Cadmus, and the murky realm
Of Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.
     Therefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,
I and these children; not as deeming thee
A new divinity, but the first of men;
First in the common accidents of life,
And first in visitations of the Gods.
Art thou not he who coming to the town
of Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid
To the fell songstress?  Nor hadst thou received
Prompting from us or been by others schooled;
No, by a god inspired (so all men deem,
And testify) didst thou renew our life.
And now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,
All we thy votaries beseech thee, find
Some succor, whether by a voice from heaven
Whispered, or haply known by human wit.
Tried counselors, methinks, are aptest found [1]
To furnish for the future pregnant rede.
Upraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!
Look to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore
Our country's savior thou art justly hailed:
O never may we thus record thy reign:--
"He raised us up only to cast us down."
Uplift us, build our city on a rock.
Thy happy star ascendant brought us luck,
O let it not decline!  If thou wouldst rule
This land, as now thou reignest, better sure
To rule a peopled than a desert realm.
Nor battlements nor galleys aught avail,
If men to man and guards to guard them tail.

OEDIPUS
Ah! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,
The quest that brings you hither and your need.
Ye sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,
How great soever yours, outtops it all.
Your sorrow touches each man severally,
Him and none other, but I grieve at once
Both for the general and myself and you.
Therefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.
Many, my children, are the tears I've wept,
And threaded many a maze of weary thought.
Thus pondering one clue of hope I caught,
And tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus' son,
Creon, my consort's brother, to inquire
Of Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,
How I might save the State by act or word.
And now I reckon up the tale of days
Since he set forth, and marvel how he fares.
'Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.
But when he comes, then I were base indeed,
If I perform not all the god declares.

PRIEST
Thy words are well timed; even as thou speakest
That shouting tells me Creon is at hand.

OEDIPUS
O King Apollo! may his joyous looks
Be presage of the joyous news he brings!

PRIEST
As I surmise, 'tis welcome; else his head
Had scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.

OEDIPUS
We soon shall know; he's now in earshot range.
[Enter CREON]
My royal cousin, say, Menoeceus' child,
What message hast thou brought us from the god?

CREON
Good news, for e'en intolerable ills,
Finding right issue, tend to naught but good.

OEDIPUS
How runs the oracle? thus far thy words
Give me no ground for confidence or fear.

CREON
If thou wouldst hear my message publicly,
I'll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.

OEDIPUS
Speak before all; the burden that I bear
Is more for these my subjects than myself.

CREON
Let me report then all the god declared.
King Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate
A fell pollution that infests the land,
And no more harbor an inveterate sore.

OEDIPUS
What expiation means he?  What's amiss?

CREON
Banishment, or the shedding blood for blood.
This stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.

OEDIPUS
Whom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?

CREON
Before thou didst assume the helm of State,
The sovereign of this land was Laius.

OEDIPUS
I heard as much, but never saw the man.

CREON
He fell; and now the god's command is plain:
Punish his takers-off, whoe'er they be.

OEDIPUS
Where are they?  Where in the wide world to find
The far, faint traces of a bygone crime?

CREON
In this land, said the god; "who seeks shall find;
Who sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind."

OEDIPUS
Was he within his palace, or afield,
Or traveling, when Laius met his fate?

CREON
Abroad; he started, so he told us, bound
For Delphi, but he never thence returned.

OEDIPUS
Came there no news, no fellow-traveler
To give some clue that might be followed up?

CREON
But one escape, who flying for dear life,
Could tell of all he saw but one thing sure.

OEDIPUS
And what was that?  One clue might lead us far,
With but a spark of hope to guide our quest.

CREON
Robbers, he told us, not one bandit but
A troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.

OEDIPUS
Did any bandit dare so bold a stroke,
Unless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?

CREON
So 'twas surmised, but none was found to avenge
His murder mid the trouble that ensued.

OEDIPUS
What trouble can have hindered a full quest,
When royalty had fallen thus miserably?

CREON
The riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide
The dim past and attend to instant needs.

OEDIPUS
Well, _I_ will start afresh and once again
Make dark things clear.  Right worthy the concern
Of Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;
I also, as is meet, will lend my aid
To avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.
Not for some far-off kinsman, but myself,
Shall I expel this poison in the blood;
For whoso slew that king might have a mind
To strike me too with his assassin hand.
Therefore in righting him I serve myself.
Up, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,
Take hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither
The Theban commons.  With the god's good help
Success is sure; 'tis ruin if we fail.
[Exeunt OEDIPUS and CREON]

PRIEST
Come, children, let us hence; these gracious words
Forestall the very purpose of our suit.
And may the god who sent this oracle
Save us withal and rid us of this pest.
[Exeunt PRIEST and SUPPLIANTS]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Sweet-voiced daughter of Zeus from thy gold-paved Pythian shrine
          Wafted to Thebes divine,
What dost thou bring me?  My soul is racked and shivers with fear.
          (Healer of Delos, hear!)
Hast thou some pain unknown before,
Or with the circling years renewest a penance of yore?
Offspring of golden Hope, thou voice immortal, O tell me.

(Ant. 1)
First on Athene I call; O Zeus-born goddess, defend!
          Goddess and sister, befriend,
Artemis, Lady of Thebes, high-throned in the midst of our mart!
          Lord of the death-winged dart!
            Your threefold aid I crave
     From death and ruin our city to save.
If in the days of old when we nigh had perished, ye drave
From our land the fiery plague, be near us now and defend us!

(Str. 2)
     Ah me, what countless woes are mine!
     All our host is in decline;
     Weaponless my spirit lies.
     Earth her gracious fruits denies;
     Women wail in barren throes;
     Life on life downstriken goes,
     Swifter than the wind bird's flight,
     Swifter than the Fire-God's might,
     To the westering shores of Night.

(Ant. 2)
     Wasted thus by death on death
     All our city perisheth.
     Corpses spread infection round;
     None to tend or mourn is found.
     Wailing on the altar stair
     Wives and grandams rend the air--
     Long-drawn moans and piercing cries
     Blent with prayers and litanies.
     Golden child of Zeus, O hear
     Let thine angel face appear!

(Str. 3)
And grant that Ares whose hot breath I feel,
          Though without targe or steel
He stalks, whose voice is as the battle shout,
May turn in sudden rout,
To the unharbored Thracian waters sped,
          Or Amphitrite's bed.
     For what night leaves undone,
     Smit by the morrow's sun
Perisheth.  Father Zeus, whose hand
Doth wield the lightning brand,
Slay him beneath thy levin bold, we pray,
          Slay him, O slay!

(Ant. 3)
O that thine arrows too, Lycean King,
          From that taut bow's gold string,
Might fly abroad, the champions of our rights;
          Yea, and the flashing lights
Of Artemis, wherewith the huntress sweeps
          Across the Lycian steeps.
Thee too I call with golden-snooded hair,
          Whose name our land doth bear,
Bacchus to whom thy Maenads Evoe shout;
          Come with thy bright torch, rout,
               Blithe god whom we adore,
               The god whom gods abhor.

[Enter OEDIPUS.]
OEDIPUS
Ye pray; 'tis well, but would ye hear my words
And heed them and apply the remedy,
Ye might perchance find comfort and relief.
Mind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger
To this report, no less than to the crime;
For how unaided could I track it far
Without a clue?  Which lacking (for too late
Was I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)
This proclamation I address to all:--
Thebans, if any knows the man by whom
Laius, son of Labdacus, was slain,
I summon him to make clean shrift to me.
And if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus
Confessing he shall 'scape the capital charge;
For the worst penalty that shall befall him
Is banishment--unscathed he shall depart.
But if an alien from a foreign land
Be known to any as the murderer,
Let him who knows speak out, and he shall have
Due recompense from me and thanks to boot.
But if ye still keep silence, if through fear
For self or friends ye disregard my hest,
Hear what I then resolve; I lay my ban
On the assassin whosoe'er he be.
Let no man in this land, whereof I hold
The sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;
Give him no part in prayer or sacrifice
Or lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.
For this is our defilement, so the god
Hath lately shown to me by oracles.
Thus as their champion I maintain the cause
Both of the god and of the murdered King.
And on the murderer this curse I lay
(On him and all the partners in his guilt):--
Wretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!
And for myself, if with my privity
He gain admittance to my hearth, I pray
The curse I laid on others fall on me.
See that ye give effect to all my hest,
For my sake and the god's and for our land,
A desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.
For, let alone the god's express command,
It were a scandal ye should leave unpurged
The murder of a great man and your king,
Nor track it home.  And now that I am lord,
Successor to his throne, his bed, his wife,
(And had he not been frustrate in the hope
Of issue, common children of one womb
Had forced a closer bond twixt him and me,
But Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I
His blood-avenger will maintain his cause
As though he were my sire, and leave no stone
Unturned to track the assassin or avenge
The son of Labdacus, of Polydore,
Of Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.
And for the disobedient thus I pray:
May the gods send them neither timely fruits
Of earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,
But may they waste and pine, as now they waste,
Aye and worse stricken; but to all of you,
My loyal subjects who approve my acts,
May Justice, our ally, and all the gods
Be gracious and attend you evermore.

CHORUS
The oath thou profferest, sire, I take and swear.
I slew him not myself, nor can I name
The slayer.  For the quest, 'twere well, methinks
That Phoebus, who proposed the riddle, himself
Should give the answer--who the murderer was.

OEDIPUS
Well argued; but no living man can hope
To force the gods to speak against their will.

CHORUS
May I then say what seems next best to me?

OEDIPUS
Aye, if there be a third best, tell it too.

CHORUS
My liege, if any man sees eye to eye
With our lord Phoebus, 'tis our prophet, lord
Teiresias; he of all men best might guide
A searcher of this matter to the light.

OEDIPUS
Here too my zeal has nothing lagged, for twice
At Creon's instance have I sent to fetch him,
And long I marvel why he is not here.

CHORUS
I mind me too of rumors long ago--
Mere gossip.

OEDIPUS
               Tell them, I would fain know all.

CHORUS
'Twas said he fell by travelers.

OEDIPUS
                                   So I heard,
But none has seen the man who saw him fall.

CHORUS
Well, if he knows what fear is, he will quail
And flee before the terror of thy curse.

OEDIPUS
Words scare not him who blenches not at deeds.

CHORUS
But here is one to arraign him.  Lo, at length
They bring the god-inspired seer in whom
Above all other men is truth inborn.
[Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy.]

OEDIPUS
Teiresias, seer who comprehendest all,
Lore of the wise and hidden mysteries,
High things of heaven and low things of the earth,
Thou knowest, though thy blinded eyes see naught,
What plague infects our city; and we turn
To thee, O seer, our one defense and shield.
The purport of the answer that the God
Returned to us who sought his oracle,
The messengers have doubtless told thee--how
One course alone could rid us of the pest,
To find the murderers of Laius,
And slay them or expel them from the land.
Therefore begrudging neither augury
Nor other divination that is thine,
O save thyself, thy country, and thy king,
Save all from this defilement of blood shed.
On thee we rest.  This is man's highest end,
To others' service all his powers to lend.

TEIRESIAS
Alas, alas, what misery to be wise
When wisdom profits nothing!  This old lore
I had forgotten; else I were not here.

OEDIPUS
What ails thee?  Why this melancholy mood?

TEIRESIAS
Let me go home; prevent me not; 'twere best
That thou shouldst bear thy burden and I mine.

OEDIPUS
For shame! no true-born Theban patriot
Would thus withhold the word of prophecy.

TEIRESIAS
_Thy_ words, O king, are wide of the mark, and I
For fear lest I too trip like thee...

OEDIPUS
                                        Oh speak,
Withhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know'st,
Thy knowledge.  We are all thy suppliants.

TEIRESIAS
Aye, for ye all are witless, but my voice
Will ne'er reveal my miseries--or thine. [2]

OEDIPUS
What then, thou knowest, and yet willst not speak!
Wouldst thou betray us and destroy the State?

TEIRESIAS
I will not vex myself nor thee.  Why ask
Thus idly what from me thou shalt not learn?

OEDIPUS
Monster! thy silence would incense a flint.
Will nothing loose thy tongue?  Can nothing melt thee,
Or shake thy dogged taciturnity?

TEIRESIAS
Thou blam'st my mood and seest not thine own
Wherewith thou art mated; no, thou taxest me.

OEDIPUS
And who could stay his choler when he heard
How insolently thou dost flout the State?

TEIRESIAS
Well, it will come what will, though I be mute.

OEDIPUS
Since come it must, thy duty is to tell me.

TEIRESIAS
I have no more to say; storm as thou willst,
And give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.

OEDIPUS
Yea, I am wroth, and will not stint my words,
But speak my whole mind.  Thou methinks thou art he,
Who planned the crime, aye, and performed it too,
All save the assassination; and if thou
Hadst not been blind, I had been sworn to boot
That thou alone didst do the bloody deed.

TEIRESIAS
Is it so?  Then I charge thee to abide
By thine own proclamation; from this day
Speak not to these or me.  Thou art the man,
Thou the accursed polluter of this land.

OEDIPUS
Vile slanderer, thou blurtest forth these taunts,
And think'st forsooth as seer to go scot free.

TEIRESIAS
Yea, I am free, strong in the strength of truth.

OEDIPUS
Who was thy teacher? not methinks thy art.

TEIRESIAS
Thou, goading me against my will to speak.

OEDIPUS
What speech? repeat it and resolve my doubt.

TEIRESIAS
Didst miss my sense wouldst thou goad me on?

OEDIPUS
I but half caught thy meaning; say it again.

TEIRESIAS
I say thou art the murderer of the man
Whose murderer thou pursuest.

OEDIPUS
                              Thou shalt rue it
Twice to repeat so gross a calumny.

TEIRESIAS
Must I say more to aggravate thy rage?

OEDIPUS
Say all thou wilt; it will be but waste of breath.

TEIRESIAS
I say thou livest with thy nearest kin
In infamy, unwitting in thy shame.

OEDIPUS
Think'st thou for aye unscathed to wag thy tongue?

TEIRESIAS
Yea, if the might of truth can aught prevail.
OEDIPUS
With other men, but not with thee, for thou
In ear, wit, eye, in everything art blind.

TEIRESIAS
Poor fool to utter gibes at me which all
Here present will cast back on thee ere long.

OEDIPUS
Offspring of endless Night, thou hast no power
O'er me or any man who sees the sun.

TEIRESIAS
No, for thy weird is not to fall by me.
I leave to Apollo what concerns the god.

OEDIPUS
Is this a plot of Creon, or thine own?

TEIRESIAS
Not Creon, thou thyself art thine own bane.

OEDIPUS
O wealth and empiry and skill by skill
Outwitted in the battlefield of life,
What spite and envy follow in your train!
See, for this crown the State conferred on me.
A gift, a thing I sought not, for this crown
The trusty Creon, my familiar friend,
Hath lain in wait to oust me and suborned
This mountebank, this juggling charlatan,
This tricksy beggar-priest, for gain alone
Keen-eyed, but in his proper art stone-blind.
Say, sirrah, hast thou ever proved thyself
A prophet?  When the riddling Sphinx was here
Why hadst thou no deliverance for this folk?
And yet the riddle was not to be solved
By guess-work but required the prophet's art;
Wherein thou wast found lacking; neither birds
Nor sign from heaven helped thee, but _I_ came,
The simple Oedipus; _I_ stopped her mouth
By mother wit, untaught of auguries.
This is the man whom thou wouldst undermine,
In hope to reign with Creon in my stead.
Methinks that thou and thine abettor soon
Will rue your plot to drive the scapegoat out.
Thank thy grey hairs that thou hast still to learn
What chastisement such arrogance deserves.

CHORUS
To us it seems that both the seer and thou,
O Oedipus, have spoken angry words.
This is no time to wrangle but consult
How best we may fulfill the oracle.

TEIRESIAS
King as thou art, free speech at least is mine
To make reply; in this I am thy peer.
I own no lord but Loxias; him I serve
And ne'er can stand enrolled as Creon's man.
Thus then I answer:  since thou hast not spared
To twit me with my blindness--thou hast eyes,
Yet see'st not in what misery thou art fallen,
Nor where thou dwellest nor with whom for mate.
Dost know thy lineage?  Nay, thou know'st it not,
And all unwitting art a double foe
To thine own kin, the living and the dead;
Aye and the dogging curse of mother and sire
One day shall drive thee, like a two-edged sword,
Beyond our borders, and the eyes that now
See clear shall henceforward endless night.
Ah whither shall thy bitter cry not reach,
What crag in all Cithaeron but shall then
Reverberate thy wail, when thou hast found
With what a hymeneal thou wast borne
Home, but to no fair haven, on the gale!
Aye, and a flood of ills thou guessest not
Shall set thyself and children in one line.
Flout then both Creon and my words, for none
Of mortals shall be striken worse than thou.

OEDIPUS
Must I endure this fellow's insolence?
A murrain on thee!  Get thee hence!  Begone
Avaunt! and never cross my threshold more.

TEIRESIAS
I ne'er had come hadst thou not bidden me.

OEDIPUS
I know not thou wouldst utter folly, else
Long hadst thou waited to be summoned here.

TEIRESIAS
Such am I--as it seems to thee a fool,
But to the parents who begat thee, wise.

OEDIPUS
What sayest thou--"parents"?  Who begat me, speak?

TEIRESIAS
This day shall be thy birth-day, and thy grave.

OEDIPUS
Thou lov'st to speak in riddles and dark words.

TEIRESIAS
In reading riddles who so skilled as thou?

OEDIPUS
Twit me with that wherein my greatness lies.

TEIRESIAS
And yet this very greatness proved thy bane.

OEDIPUS
No matter if I saved the commonwealth.

TEIRESIAS
'Tis time I left thee.  Come, boy, take me home.

OEDIPUS
Aye, take him quickly, for his presence irks
And lets me; gone, thou canst not plague me more.

TEIRESIAS
I go, but first will tell thee why I came.
Thy frown I dread not, for thou canst not harm me.
Hear then:  this man whom thou hast sought to arrest
With threats and warrants this long while, the wretch
Who murdered Laius--that man is here.
He passes for an alien in the land
But soon shall prove a Theban, native born.
And yet his fortune brings him little joy;
For blind of seeing, clad in beggar's weeds,
For purple robes, and leaning on his staff,
To a strange land he soon shall grope his way.
And of the children, inmates of his home,
He shall be proved the brother and the sire,
Of her who bare him son and husband both,
Co-partner, and assassin of his sire.
Go in and ponder this, and if thou find
That I have missed the mark, henceforth declare
I have no wit nor skill in prophecy.
[Exeunt TEIRESIAS and OEDIPUS]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Who is he by voice immortal named from Pythia's rocky cell,
Doer of foul deeds of bloodshed, horrors that no tongue can tell?
          A foot for flight he needs
          Fleeter than storm-swift steeds,
          For on his heels doth follow,
Armed with the lightnings of his Sire, Apollo.
          Like sleuth-hounds too
          The Fates pursue.

(Ant. 1)
Yea, but now flashed forth the summons from Parnassus' snowy peak,
"Near and far the undiscovered doer of this murder seek!"
          Now like a sullen bull he roves
          Through forest brakes and upland groves,
          And vainly seeks to fly
          The doom that ever nigh
          Flits o'er his head,
Still by the avenging Phoebus sped,
          The voice divine,
          From Earth's mid shrine.
(Str. 2)
Sore perplexed am I by the words of the master seer.
Are  they true, are they false?  I know not and bridle my  tongue for
   fear,
Fluttered with vague surmise; nor present nor future is clear.
Quarrel of ancient date or in days still near know I none
Twixt the Labdacidan house and our ruler, Polybus' son.
Proof is there none:  how then can I challenge our King's good name,
How in a blood-feud join for an untracked deed of shame?

(Ant. 2)
All wise are Zeus and Apollo, and nothing is hid from their ken;
They are gods; and in wits a man may surpass his fellow men;
But that a mortal seer knows more than I know--where
Hath this been proven?  Or how without sign assured, can I blame
Him who saved our State when the winged songstress came,
Tested and tried in the light of us all, like gold assayed?
How can I now assent when a crime is on Oedipus laid?

CREON
Friends, countrymen, I learn King Oedipus
Hath laid against me a most grievous charge,
And come to you protesting.  If he deems
That I have harmed or injured him in aught
By word or deed in this our present trouble,
I care not to prolong the span of life,
Thus ill-reputed; for the calumny
Hits not a single blot, but blasts my name,
If by the general voice I am denounced
False to the State and false by you my friends.

CHORUS
This taunt, it well may be, was blurted out
In petulance, not spoken advisedly.

CREON
Did any dare pretend that it was I
Prompted the seer to utter a forged charge?

CHORUS
Such things were said; with what intent I know not.

CREON
Were not his wits and vision all astray
When upon me he fixed this monstrous charge?

CHORUS
I know not; to my sovereign's acts I am blind.
But lo, he comes to answer for himself.
[Enter OEDIPUS.]

OEDIPUS
Sirrah, what mak'st thou here?  Dost thou presume
To approach my doors, thou brazen-faced rogue,
My murderer and the filcher of my crown?
Come, answer this, didst thou detect in me
Some touch of cowardice or witlessness,
That made thee undertake this enterprise?
I seemed forsooth too simple to perceive
The serpent stealing on me in the dark,
Or else too weak to scotch it when I saw.
This _thou_ art witless seeking to possess
Without a following or friends the crown,
A prize that followers and wealth must win.

CREON
Attend me.  Thou hast spoken, 'tis my turn
To make reply.  Then having heard me, judge.

OEDIPUS
Thou art glib of tongue, but I am slow to learn
Of thee; I know too well thy venomous hate.

CREON
First I would argue out this very point.

OEDIPUS
O argue not that thou art not a rogue.

CREON
If thou dost count a virtue stubbornness,
Unschooled by reason, thou art much astray.

OEDIPUS
If thou dost hold a kinsman may be wronged,
And no pains follow, thou art much to seek.

CREON
Therein thou judgest rightly, but this wrong
That thou allegest--tell me what it is.

OEDIPUS
Didst thou or didst thou not advise that I
Should call the priest?

CREON
                         Yes, and I stand to it.

OEDIPUS
Tell me how long is it since Laius...

CREON
Since Laius...?  I follow not thy drift.

OEDIPUS
By violent hands was spirited away.

CREON
In the dim past, a many years agone.

OEDIPUS
Did the same prophet then pursue his craft?

CREON
Yes, skilled as now and in no less repute.

OEDIPUS
Did he at that time ever glance at me?

CREON
Not to my knowledge, not when I was by.

OEDIPUS
But was no search and inquisition made?

CREON
Surely full quest was made, but nothing learnt.

OEDIPUS
Why failed the seer to tell his story _then_?

CREON
I know not, and not knowing hold my tongue.

OEDIPUS
This much thou knowest and canst surely tell.

CREON
What's mean'st thou?  All I know I will declare.

OEDIPUS
But for thy prompting never had the seer
Ascribed to me the death of Laius.

CREON
If so he thou knowest best; but I
Would put thee to the question in my turn.

OEDIPUS
Question and prove me murderer if thou canst.

CREON
Then let me ask thee, didst thou wed my sister?

OEDIPUS
A fact so plain I cannot well deny.

CREON
And as thy consort queen she shares the throne?

OEDIPUS
I grant her freely all her heart desires.

CREON
And with you twain I share the triple rule?

OEDIPUS
Yea, and it is that proves thee a false friend.

CREON
Not so, if thou wouldst reason with thyself,
As I with myself.  First, I bid thee think,
Would any mortal choose a troubled reign
Of terrors rather than secure repose,
If the same power were given him?  As for me,
I have no natural craving for the name
Of king, preferring to do kingly deeds,
And so thinks every sober-minded man.
Now all my needs are satisfied through thee,
And I have naught to fear; but were I king,
My acts would oft run counter to my will.
How could a title then have charms for me
Above the sweets of boundless influence?
I am not so infatuate as to grasp
The shadow when I hold the substance fast.
Now all men cry me Godspeed! wish me well,
And every suitor seeks to gain my ear,
If he would hope to win a grace from thee.
Why should I leave the better, choose the worse?
That were sheer madness, and I am not mad.
No such ambition ever tempted me,
Nor would I have a share in such intrigue.
And if thou doubt me, first to Delphi go,
There ascertain if my report was true
Of the god's answer; next investigate
If with the seer I plotted or conspired,
And if it prove so, sentence me to death,
Not by thy voice alone, but mine and thine.
But O condemn me not, without appeal,
On bare suspicion.  'Tis not right to adjudge
Bad men at random good, or good men bad.
I would as lief a man should cast away
The thing he counts most precious, his own life,
As spurn a true friend.  Thou wilt learn in time
The truth, for time alone reveals the just;
A villain is detected in a day.

CHORUS
To one who walketh warily his words
Commend themselves; swift counsels are not sure.

OEDIPUS
When with swift strides the stealthy plotter stalks
I must be quick too with my counterplot.
To wait his onset passively, for him
Is sure success, for me assured defeat.

CREON
What then's thy will?  To banish me the land?

OEDIPUS
I would not have thee banished, no, but dead,
That men may mark the wages envy reaps.

CREON
I see thou wilt not yield, nor credit me.

OEDIPUS
[None but a fool would credit such as thou.] [3]

CREON
Thou art not wise.

OEDIPUS
                    Wise for myself at least.

CREON
Why not for me too?

OEDIPUS
                    Why for such a knave?

CREON
Suppose thou lackest sense.

OEDIPUS
                              Yet kings must rule.

CREON
Not if they rule ill.

OEDIPUS
                         Oh my Thebans, hear him!

CREON
Thy Thebans? am not I a Theban too?

CHORUS
Cease, princes; lo there comes, and none too soon,
Jocasta from the palace.  Who so fit
As peacemaker to reconcile your feud?
[Enter JOCASTA.]

JOCASTA
Misguided princes, why have ye upraised
This wordy wrangle?  Are ye not ashamed,
While the whole land lies striken, thus to voice
Your private injuries?  Go in, my lord;
Go home, my brother, and forebear to make
A public scandal of a petty grief.

CREON
My royal sister, Oedipus, thy lord,
Hath bid me choose (O dread alternative!)
An outlaw's exile or a felon's death.

OEDIPUS
Yes, lady; I have caught him practicing
Against my royal person his vile arts.

CREON
May I ne'er speed but die accursed, if I
In any way am guilty of this charge.

JOCASTA
Believe him, I adjure thee, Oedipus,
First for his solemn oath's sake, then for mine,
And for thine elders' sake who wait on thee.

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Hearken, King, reflect, we pray thee, but not stubborn but relent.

OEDIPUS
Say to what should I consent?

CHORUS
Respect a man whose probity and troth
Are known to all and now confirmed by oath.

OEDIPUS
Dost know what grace thou cravest?

CHORUS
                                   Yea, I know.

OEDIPUS
Declare it then and make thy meaning plain.

CHORUS
Brand not a friend whom babbling tongues assail;
Let not suspicion 'gainst his oath prevail.

OEDIPUS
Bethink you that in seeking this ye seek
In very sooth my death or banishment?

CHORUS
No, by the leader of the host divine!
(Str. 2)
Witness, thou Sun, such thought was never mine,
Unblest, unfriended may I perish,
If ever I such wish did cherish!
But O my heart is desolate
Musing on our striken State,
Doubly fall'n should discord grow
Twixt you twain, to crown our woe.

OEDIPUS
Well, let him go, no matter what it cost me,
Or certain death or shameful banishment,
For your sake I relent, not his; and him,
Where'er he be, my heart shall still abhor.

CREON
Thou art as sullen in thy yielding mood
As in thine anger thou wast truculent.
Such tempers justly plague themselves the most.

OEDIPUS
Leave me in peace and get thee gone.

CREON
                                   I go,
By thee misjudged, but justified by these.
[Exeunt CREON]

CHORUS
(Ant. 1)
Lady, lead indoors thy consort; wherefore longer here delay?

JOCASTA
Tell me first how rose the fray.

CHORUS
Rumors bred unjust suspicious and injustice rankles sore.

JOCASTA
Were both at fault?

CHORUS
                    Both.

JOCASTA
                         What was the tale?

CHORUS
Ask me no more.  The land is sore distressed;
'Twere better sleeping ills to leave at rest.

OEDIPUS
Strange counsel, friend!  I know thou mean'st me well,
And yet would'st mitigate and blunt my zeal.

CHORUS
(Ant. 2)
King, I say it once again,
Witless were I proved, insane,
If I lightly put away
Thee my country's prop and stay,
Pilot who, in danger sought,
To a quiet haven brought
Our distracted State; and now
Who can guide us right but thou?

JOCASTA
Let me too, I adjure thee, know, O king,
What cause has stirred this unrelenting wrath.

OEDIPUS
I will, for thou art more to me than these.
Lady, the cause is Creon and his plots.

JOCASTA
But what provoked the quarrel? make this clear.

OEDIPUS
He points me out as Laius' murderer.

JOCASTA
Of his own knowledge or upon report?

OEDIPUS
He is too cunning to commit himself,
And makes a mouthpiece of a knavish seer.

JOCASTA
Then thou mayest ease thy conscience on that score.
Listen and I'll convince thee that no man
Hath scot or lot in the prophetic art.
Here is the proof in brief.  An oracle
Once came to Laius (I will not say
'Twas from the Delphic god himself, but from
His ministers) declaring he was doomed
To perish by the hand of his own son,
A child that should be born to him by me.
Now Laius--so at least report affirmed--
Was murdered on a day by highwaymen,
No natives, at a spot where three roads meet.
As for the child, it was but three days old,
When Laius, its ankles pierced and pinned
Together, gave it to be cast away
By others on the trackless mountain side.
So then Apollo brought it not to pass
The child should be his father's murderer,
Or the dread terror find accomplishment,
And Laius be slain by his own son.
Such was the prophet's horoscope.  O king,
Regard it not.  Whate'er the god deems fit
To search, himself unaided will reveal.

OEDIPUS
What memories, what wild tumult of the soul
Came o'er me, lady, as I heard thee speak!

JOCASTA
What mean'st thou?  What has shocked and startled thee?

OEDIPUS
Methought I heard thee say that Laius
Was murdered at the meeting of three roads.

JOCASTA
So ran the story that is current still.

OEDIPUS
Where did this happen?  Dost thou know the place?

JOCASTA
Phocis the land is called; the spot is where
Branch roads from Delphi and from Daulis meet.

OEDIPUS
And how long is it since these things befell?

JOCASTA
'Twas but a brief while were thou wast proclaimed
Our country's ruler that the news was brought.

OEDIPUS
O Zeus, what hast thou willed to do with me!

JOCASTA
What is it, Oedipus, that moves thee so?

OEDIPUS
Ask me not yet; tell me the build and height
Of Laius?  Was he still in manhood's prime?

JOCASTA
Tall was he, and his hair was lightly strewn
With silver; and not unlike thee in form.

OEDIPUS
O woe is me!  Mehtinks unwittingly
I laid but now a dread curse on myself.

JOCASTA
What say'st thou?  When I look upon thee, my king,
I tremble.

OEDIPUS
          'Tis a dread presentiment
That in the end the seer will prove not blind.
One further question to resolve my doubt.

JOCASTA
I quail; but ask, and I will answer all.

OEDIPUS
Had he but few attendants or a train
Of armed retainers with him, like a prince?

JOCASTA
They were but five in all, and one of them
A herald; Laius in a mule-car rode.

OEDIPUS
Alas! 'tis clear as noonday now.  But say,
Lady, who carried this report to Thebes?

JOCASTA
A serf, the sole survivor who returned.

OEDIPUS
Haply he is at hand or in the house?

JOCASTA
No, for as soon as he returned and found
Thee reigning in the stead of Laius slain,
He clasped my hand and supplicated me
To send him to the alps and pastures, where
He might be farthest from the sight of Thebes.
And so I sent him.  'Twas an honest slave
And well deserved some better recompense.

OEDIPUS
Fetch him at once.  I fain would see the man.

JOCASTA
He shall be brought; but wherefore summon him?

OEDIPUS
Lady, I fear my tongue has overrun
Discretion; therefore I would question him.

JOCASTA
Well, he shall come, but may not I too claim
To share the burden of thy heart, my king?

OEDIPUS
And thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish.
Now my imaginings have gone so far.
Who has a higher claim that thou to hear
My tale of dire adventures?  Listen then.
My sire was Polybus of Corinth, and
My mother Merope, a Dorian;
And I was held the foremost citizen,
Till a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,
Yet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.
A roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,
Shouted "Thou art not true son of thy sire."
It irked me, but I stomached for the nonce
The insult; on the morrow I sought out
My mother and my sire and questioned them.
They were indignant at the random slur
Cast on my parentage and did their best
To comfort me, but still the venomed barb
Rankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.
So privily without their leave I went
To Delphi, and Apollo sent me back
Baulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.
But other grievous things he prophesied,
Woes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;
To wit I should defile my mother's bed
And raise up seed too loathsome to behold,
And slay the father from whose loins I sprang.
Then, lady,--thou shalt hear the very truth--
As I drew near the triple-branching roads,
A herald met me and a man who sat
In a car drawn by colts--as in thy tale--
The man in front and the old man himself
Threatened to thrust me rudely from the path,
Then jostled by the charioteer in wrath
I struck him, and the old man, seeing this,
Watched till I passed and from his car brought down
Full on my head the double-pointed goad.
     Yet was I quits with him and more; one stroke
Of my good staff sufficed to fling him clean
Out of the chariot seat and laid him prone.
And so I slew them every one.  But if
Betwixt this stranger there was aught in common
With Laius, who more miserable than I,
What mortal could you find more god-abhorred?
Wretch whom no sojourner, no citizen
May harbor or address, whom all are bound
To harry from their homes.  And this same curse
Was laid on me, and laid by none but me.
Yea with  these hands all gory I pollute
The bed of him I slew.  Say, am I vile?
Am I not utterly unclean, a wretch
Doomed to be banished, and in banishment
Forgo the sight of all my dearest ones,
And never tread again my native earth;
Or else to wed my mother and slay my sire,
Polybus, who begat me and upreared?
If one should say, this is the handiwork
Of some inhuman power, who could blame
His judgment?  But, ye pure and awful gods,
Forbid, forbid that I should see that day!
May I be blotted out from living men
Ere such a plague spot set on me its brand!

CHORUS
We too, O king, are troubled; but till thou
Hast questioned the survivor, still hope on.

OEDIPUS
My hope is faint, but still enough survives
To bid me bide the coming of this herd.

JOCASTA
Suppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?

OEDIPUS
I'll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees
With thine, I shall have 'scaped calamity.

JOCASTA
And what of special import did I say?

OEDIPUS
In thy report of what the herdsman said
Laius was slain by robbers; now if he
Still speaks of robbers, not a robber, I
Slew him not; "one" with "many" cannot square.
But if he says one lonely wayfarer,
The last link wanting to my guilt is forged.

JOCASTA
Well, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,
Nor can he now retract what then he said;
Not I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.
E'en should he vary somewhat in his story,
He cannot make the death of Laius
In any wise jump with the oracle.
For Loxias said expressly he was doomed
To die by my child's hand, but he, poor babe,
He shed no blood, but perished first himself.
So much for divination.  Henceforth I
Will look for signs neither to right nor left.

OEDIPUS
Thou reasonest well.  Still I would have thee send
And fetch the bondsman hither.  See to it.

JOCASTA
That will I straightway.  Come, let us within.
I would do nothing that my lord mislikes.
[Exeunt OEDIPUS and JOCASTA]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
My lot be still to lead
     The life of innocence and fly
Irreverence in word or deed,
     To follow still those laws ordained on high
Whose birthplace is the bright ethereal sky
     No mortal birth they own,
     Olympus their progenitor alone:
Ne'er shall they slumber in oblivion cold,
The god in them is strong and grows not old.

(Ant. 1)
     Of insolence is bred
The tyrant; insolence full blown,
     With empty riches surfeited,
Scales the precipitous height and grasps the throne.
     Then topples o'er and lies in ruin prone;
     No foothold on that dizzy steep.
But O may Heaven the true patriot keep
Who burns with emulous zeal to serve the State.
God is my help and hope, on him I wait.

(Str. 2)
But the proud sinner, or in word or deed,
     That will not Justice heed,
     Nor reverence the shrine
     Of images divine,
Perdition seize his vain imaginings,
     If, urged by greed profane,
     He grasps at ill-got gain,
And lays an impious hand on holiest things.
     Who when such deeds are done
     Can hope heaven's bolts to shun?
If sin like this to honor can aspire,
Why dance I still and lead the sacred choir?

(Ant. 2)
No more I'll seek earth's central oracle,
     Or Abae's hallowed cell,
     Nor to Olympia bring
     My votive offering.
If before all God's truth be not bade plain.
     O Zeus, reveal thy might,
     King, if thou'rt named aright
Omnipotent, all-seeing, as of old;
     For Laius is forgot;
     His weird, men heed it not;
Apollo is forsook and faith grows cold.
[Enter JOCASTA.]

JOCASTA
My lords, ye look amazed to see your queen
With wreaths and gifts of incense in her hands.
I had a mind to visit the high shrines,
For Oedipus is overwrought, alarmed
With terrors manifold.  He will not use
His past experience, like a man of sense,
To judge the present need, but lends an ear
To any croaker if he augurs ill.
Since then my counsels naught avail, I turn
To thee, our present help in time of trouble,
Apollo, Lord Lycean, and to thee
My prayers and supplications here I bring.
Lighten us, lord, and cleanse us from this curse!
For now we all are cowed like mariners
Who see their helmsman dumbstruck in the storm.
[Enter Corinthian MESSENGER.]

MESSENGER
My masters, tell me where the palace is
Of Oedipus; or better, where's the king.

CHORUS
Here is the palace and he bides within;
This is his queen the mother of his children.

MESSENGER
All happiness attend her and the house,
Blessed is her husband and her marriage-bed.

JOCASTA
My greetings to thee, stranger; thy fair words
Deserve a like response.  But tell me why
Thou comest--what thy need or what thy news.

MESSENGER
Good for thy consort and the royal house.

JOCASTA
What may it be?  Whose messenger art thou?

MESSENGER
The Isthmian commons have resolved to make
Thy husband king--so 'twas reported there.

JOCASTA
What! is not aged Polybus still king?

MESSENGER
No, verily; he's dead and in his grave.

JOCASTA
What! is he dead, the sire of Oedipus?

MESSENGER
If I speak falsely, may I die myself.

JOCASTA
Quick, maiden, bear these tidings to my lord.
Ye god-sent oracles, where stand ye now!
This is the man whom Oedipus long shunned,
In dread to prove his murderer; and now
He dies in nature's course, not by his hand.
[Enter OEDIPUS.]

OEDIPUS
My wife, my queen, Jocasta, why hast thou
Summoned me from my palace?

JOCASTA
                              Hear this man,
And as thou hearest judge what has become
Of all those awe-inspiring oracles.

OEDIPUS
Who is this man, and what his news for me?

JOCASTA
He comes from Corinth and his message this:
Thy father Polybus hath passed away.

OEDIPUS
What? let me have it, stranger, from thy mouth.

MESSENGER
If I must first make plain beyond a doubt
My message, know that Polybus is dead.

OEDIPUS
By treachery, or by sickness visited?

MESSENGER
One touch will send an old man to his rest.

OEDIPUS
So of some malady he died, poor man.

MESSENGER
Yes, having measured the full span of years.

OEDIPUS
Out on it, lady! why should one regard
The Pythian hearth or birds that scream i' the air?
Did they not point at me as doomed to slay
My father? but he's dead and in his grave
And here am I who ne'er unsheathed a sword;
Unless the longing for his absent son
Killed him and so _I_ slew him in a sense.
But, as they stand, the oracles are dead--
Dust, ashes, nothing, dead as Polybus.

JOCASTA
Say, did not I foretell this long ago?

OEDIPUS
Thou didst:  but I was misled by my fear.

JOCASTA
Then let I no more weigh upon thy soul.

OEDIPUS
Must I not fear my mother's marriage bed.

JOCASTA
Why should a mortal man, the sport of chance,
With no assured foreknowledge, be afraid?
Best live a careless life from hand to mouth.
This wedlock with thy mother fear not thou.
How oft it chances that in dreams a man
Has wed his mother!  He who least regards
Such brainsick phantasies lives most at ease.

OEDIPUS
I should have shared in full thy confidence,
Were not my mother living; since she lives
Though half convinced I still must live in dread.

JOCASTA
And yet thy sire's death lights out darkness much.

OEDIPUS
Much, but my fear is touching her who lives.

MESSENGER
Who may this woman be whom thus you fear?

OEDIPUS
Merope, stranger, wife of Polybus.

MESSENGER
And what of her can cause you any fear?

OEDIPUS
A heaven-sent oracle of dread import.

MESSENGER
A mystery, or may a stranger hear it?

OEDIPUS
Aye, 'tis no secret.  Loxias once foretold
That I should mate with mine own mother, and shed
With my own hands the blood of my own sire.
Hence Corinth was for many a year to me
A home distant; and I trove abroad,
But missed the sweetest sight, my parents' face.

MESSENGER
Was this the fear that exiled thee from home?

OEDIPUS
Yea, and the dread of slaying my own sire.

MESSENGER
Why, since I came to give thee pleasure, King,
Have I not rid thee of this second fear?

OEDIPUS
Well, thou shalt have due guerdon for thy pains.

MESSENGER
Well, I confess what chiefly made me come
Was hope to profit by thy coming home.

OEDIPUS
Nay, I will ne'er go near my parents more.

MESSENGER
My son, 'tis plain, thou know'st not what thou doest.

OEDIPUS
How so, old man?  For heaven's sake tell me all.

MESSENGER
If this is why thou dreadest to return.

OEDIPUS
Yea, lest the god's word be fulfilled in me.

MESSENGER
Lest through thy parents thou shouldst be accursed?

OEDIPUS
This and none other is my constant dread.

MESSENGER
Dost thou not know thy fears are baseless all?

OEDIPUS
How baseless, if I am their very son?

MESSENGER
Since Polybus was naught to thee in blood.

OEDIPUS
What say'st thou? was not Polybus my sire?

MESSENGER
As much thy sire as I am, and no more.

OEDIPUS
My sire no more to me than one who is naught?

MESSENGER
Since I begat thee not, no more did he.

OEDIPUS
What reason had he then to call me son?

MESSENGER
Know that he took thee from my hands, a gift.

OEDIPUS
Yet, if no child of his, he loved me well.

MESSENGER
A childless man till then, he warmed to thee.

OEDIPUS
A foundling or a purchased slave, this child?

MESSENGER
I found thee in Cithaeron's wooded glens.

OEDIPUS
What led thee to explore those upland glades?

MESSENGER
My business was to tend the mountain flocks.

OEDIPUS
A vagrant shepherd journeying for hire?

MESSENGER
True, but thy savior in that hour, my son.

OEDIPUS
My savior? from what harm? what ailed me then?

MESSENGER
Those ankle joints are evidence enow.

OEDIPUS
Ah, why remind me of that ancient sore?

MESSENGER
I loosed the pin that riveted thy feet.

OEDIPUS
Yes, from my cradle that dread brand I bore.

MESSENGER
Whence thou deriv'st the name that still is thine.

OEDIPUS
Who did it?  I adjure thee, tell me who
Say, was it father, mother?

MESSENGER
                              I know not.
The man from whom I had thee may know more.

OEDIPUS
What, did another find me, not thyself?

MESSENGER
Not I; another shepherd gave thee me.

OEDIPUS
Who was he?  Would'st thou know again the man?

MESSENGER
He passed indeed for one of Laius' house.

OEDIPUS
The king who ruled the country long ago?

MESSENGER
The same:  he was a herdsman of the king.

OEDIPUS
And is he living still for me to see him?

MESSENGER
His fellow-countrymen should best know that.

OEDIPUS
Doth any bystander among you know
The herd he speaks of, or by seeing him
Afield or in the city? answer straight!
The hour hath come to clear this business up.

CHORUS
Methinks he means none other than the hind
Whom thou anon wert fain to see; but that
Our queen Jocasta best of all could tell.

OEDIPUS
Madam, dost know the man we sent to fetch?
Is the same of whom the stranger speaks?

JOCASTA
Who is the man?  What matter?  Let it be.
'Twere waste of thought to weigh such idle words.

OEDIPUS
No, with such guiding clues I cannot fail
To bring to light the secret of my birth.

JOCASTA
Oh, as thou carest for thy life, give o'er
This quest.  Enough the anguish _I_ endure.

OEDIPUS
Be of good cheer; though I be proved the son
Of a bondwoman, aye, through three descents
Triply a slave, thy honor is unsmirched.

JOCASTA
Yet humor me, I pray thee; do not this.

OEDIPUS
I cannot; I must probe this matter home.

JOCASTA
'Tis for thy sake I advise thee for the best.

OEDIPUS
I grow impatient of this best advice.

JOCASTA
Ah mayst thou ne'er discover who thou art!

OEDIPUS
Go, fetch me here the herd, and leave yon woman
To glory in her pride of ancestry.

JOCASTA
O woe is thee, poor wretch!  With that last word
I leave thee, henceforth silent evermore.
[Exit JOCASTA]

CHORUS
Why, Oedipus, why stung with passionate grief
Hath the queen thus departed?  Much I fear
From this dead calm will burst a storm of woes.

OEDIPUS
Let the storm burst, my fixed resolve still holds,
To learn my lineage, be it ne'er so low.
It may be she with all a woman's pride
Thinks scorn of my base parentage.  But I
Who rank myself as Fortune's favorite child,
The giver of good gifts, shall not be shamed.
She is my mother and the changing moons
My brethren, and with them I wax and wane.
Thus sprung why should I fear to trace my birth?
Nothing can make me other than I am.

CHORUS
(Str.)
If my soul prophetic err not, if my wisdom aught avail,
          Thee, Cithaeron, I shall hail,
As the nurse and foster-mother of our Oedipus shall greet
Ere tomorrow's full moon rises, and exalt thee as is meet.
Dance and song shall hymn thy praises, lover of our royal race.
          Phoebus, may my words find grace!

(Ant.)
Child,  who bare thee, nymph or goddess? sure thy sure was  more  than
man,
          Haply the hill-roamer Pan.
Of did Loxias beget thee, for he haunts the upland wold;
Or Cyllene's lord, or Bacchus, dweller on the hilltops cold?
Did some Heliconian Oread give him thee, a new-born joy?
          Nymphs with whom he love to toy?

OEDIPUS
Elders, if I, who never yet before
Have met the man, may make a guess, methinks
I see the herdsman who we long have sought;
His time-worn aspect matches with the years
Of yonder aged messenger; besides
I seem to recognize the men who bring him
As servants of my own.  But you, perchance,
Having in past days known or seen the herd,
May better by sure knowledge my surmise.

CHORUS
I recognize him; one of Laius' house;
A simple hind, but true as any man.
[Enter HERDSMAN.]

OEDIPUS
Corinthian, stranger, I address thee first,
Is this the man thou meanest!

MESSENGER
                              This is he.

OEDIPUS
And now old man, look up and answer all
I ask thee.  Wast thou once of Laius' house?

HERDSMAN
I was, a thrall, not purchased but home-bred.

OEDIPUS
What was thy business? how wast thou employed?

HERDSMAN
The best part of my life I tended sheep.

OEDIPUS
What were the pastures thou didst most frequent?

HERDSMAN
Cithaeron and the neighboring alps.

OEDIPUS
                                   Then there
Thou must have known yon man, at least by fame?

HERDSMAN
Yon man? in what way? what man dost thou mean?

OEDIPUS
The man here, having met him in past times...

HERDSMAN
Off-hand I cannot call him well to mind.

MESSENGER
No wonder, master.  But I will revive
His blunted memories.  Sure he can recall
What time together both we drove our flocks,
He two, I one, on the Cithaeron range,
For three long summers; I his mate from spring
Till rose Arcturus; then in winter time
I led mine home, he his to Laius' folds.
Did these things happen as I say, or no?

HERDSMAN
'Tis long ago, but all thou say'st is true.

MESSENGER
Well, thou mast then remember giving me
A child to rear as my own foster-son?

HERDSMAN
Why dost thou ask this question?  What of that?

MESSENGER
Friend, he that stands before thee was that child.

HERDSMAN
A plague upon thee!  Hold thy wanton tongue!

OEDIPUS
Softly, old man, rebuke him not; thy words
Are more deserving chastisement than his.

HERDSMAN
O best of masters, what is my offense?

OEDIPUS
Not answering what he asks about the child.

HERDSMAN
He speaks at random, babbles like a fool.

OEDIPUS
If thou lack'st grace to speak, I'll loose thy tongue.

HERDSMAN
For mercy's sake abuse not an old man.

OEDIPUS
Arrest the villain, seize and pinion him!

HERDSMAN
Alack, alack!
What have I done? what wouldst thou further learn?

OEDIPUS
Didst give this man the child of whom he asks?

HERDSMAN
I did; and would that I had died that day!

OEDIPUS
And die thou shalt unless thou tell the truth.

HERDSMAN
But, if I tell it, I am doubly lost.

OEDIPUS
The knave methinks will still prevaricate.

HERDSMAN
Nay, I confessed I gave it long ago.

OEDIPUS
Whence came it? was it thine, or given to thee?

HERDSMAN
I had it from another, 'twas not mine.

OEDIPUS
From whom of these our townsmen, and what house?

HERDSMAN
Forbear for God's sake, master, ask no more.

OEDIPUS
If I must question thee again, thou'rt lost.

HERDSMAN
Well then--it was a child of Laius' house.

OEDIPUS
Slave-born or one of Laius' own race?

HERDSMAN
Ah me!
I stand upon the perilous edge of speech.

OEDIPUS
And I of hearing, but I still must hear.

HERDSMAN
Know then the child was by repute his own,
But she within, thy consort best could tell.

OEDIPUS
What! she, she gave it thee?

HERDSMAN
                              'Tis so, my king.

OEDIPUS
With what intent?

HERDSMAN
                    To make away with it.

OEDIPUS
What, she its mother.

HERDSMAN
                    Fearing a dread weird.

OEDIPUS
What weird?

HERDSMAN
          'Twas told that he should slay his sire.

OEDIPUS
What didst thou give it then to this old man?

HERDSMAN
Through pity, master, for the babe.  I thought
He'd take it to the country whence he came;
But he preserved it for the worst of woes.
For if thou art in sooth what this man saith,
God pity thee! thou wast to misery born.

OEDIPUS
Ah me! ah me! all brought to pass, all true!
O light, may I behold thee nevermore!
I stand a wretch, in birth, in wedlock cursed,
A parricide, incestuously, triply cursed!
[Exit OEDIPUS]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
          Races of mortal man
          Whose life is but a span,
I count ye but the shadow of a shade!
          For he who most doth know
          Of bliss, hath but the show;
A moment, and the visions pale and fade.
Thy fall, O Oedipus, thy piteous fall
Warns me none born of women blest to call.

(Ant. 1)
          For he of marksmen best,
          O Zeus, outshot the rest,
And won the prize supreme of wealth and power.
          By him the vulture maid
          Was quelled, her witchery laid;
He rose our savior and the land's strong tower.
We hailed thee king and from that day adored
Of mighty Thebes the universal lord.

(Str. 2)
          O heavy hand of fate!
          Who now more desolate,
Whose tale more sad than thine, whose lot more dire?
          O Oedipus, discrowned head,
          Thy cradle was thy marriage bed;
One harborage sufficed for son and sire.
How could the soil thy father eared so long
Endure to bear in silence such a wrong?

(Ant. 2)
          All-seeing Time hath caught
          Guilt, and to justice brought
The son and sire commingled in one bed.
          O child of Laius' ill-starred race
          Would I had ne'er beheld thy face;
I raise for thee a dirge as o'er the dead.
Yet, sooth to say, through thee I drew new breath,
And now through thee I feel a second death.
[Enter SECOND MESSENGER.]

SECOND MESSENGER
Most grave and reverend senators of Thebes,
What Deeds ye soon must hear, what sights behold
How will ye mourn, if, true-born patriots,
Ye reverence still the race of Labdacus!
Not Ister nor all Phasis' flood, I ween,
Could wash away the blood-stains from this house,
The ills it shrouds or soon will bring to light,
Ills wrought of malice, not unwittingly.
The worst to bear are self-inflicted wounds.

CHORUS
Grievous enough for all our tears and groans
Our past calamities; what canst thou add?

SECOND MESSENGER
My tale is quickly told and quickly heard.
Our sovereign lady queen Jocasta's dead.

CHORUS
Alas, poor queen! how came she by her death?

SECOND MESSENGER
By her own hand.  And all the horror of it,
Not having seen, yet cannot comprehend.
Nathless, as far as my poor memory serves,
I will relate the unhappy lady's woe.
When in her frenzy she had passed inside
The vestibule, she hurried straight to win
The bridal-chamber, clutching at her hair
With both her hands, and, once within the room,
She shut the doors behind her with a crash.
"Laius," she cried, and called her husband dead
Long, long ago; her thought was of that child
By him begot, the son by whom the sire
Was murdered and the mother left to breed
With her own seed, a monstrous progeny.
Then she bewailed the marriage bed whereon
Poor wretch, she had conceived a double brood,
Husband by husband, children by her child.
What happened after that I cannot tell,
Nor how the end befell, for with a shriek
Burst on us Oedipus; all eyes were fixed
On Oedipus, as up and down he strode,
Nor could we mark her agony to the end.
For stalking to and fro "A sword!" he cried,
"Where is the wife, no wife, the teeming womb
That bore a double harvest, me and mine?"
And in his frenzy some supernal power
(No mortal, surely, none of us who watched him)
Guided his footsteps; with a terrible shriek,
As though one beckoned him, he crashed against
The folding doors, and from their staples forced
The wrenched bolts and hurled himself within.
Then we beheld the woman hanging there,
A running noose entwined about her neck.
But when he saw her, with a maddened roar
He loosed the cord; and when her wretched corpse
Lay stretched on earth, what followed--O 'twas dread!
He tore the golden brooches that upheld
Her queenly robes, upraised them high and smote
Full on his eye-balls, uttering words like these:
"No more shall ye behold such sights of woe,
Deeds I have suffered and myself have wrought;
Henceforward quenched in darkness shall ye see
Those ye should ne'er have seen; now blind to those
Whom, when I saw, I vainly yearned to know."
     Such was the burden of his moan, whereto,
Not once but oft, he struck with his hand uplift
His eyes, and at each stroke the ensanguined orbs
Bedewed his beard, not oozing drop by drop,
But one black gory downpour, thick as hail.
Such evils, issuing from the double source,
Have whelmed them both, confounding man and wife.
Till now the storied fortune of this house
Was fortunate indeed; but from this day
Woe, lamentation, ruin, death, disgrace,
All ills that can be named, all, all are theirs.

CHORUS
But hath he still no respite from his pain?

SECOND MESSENGER
He cries, "Unbar the doors and let all Thebes
Behold the slayer of his sire, his mother's--"
That shameful word my lips may not repeat.
He vows to fly self-banished from the land,
Nor stay to bring upon his house the curse
Himself had uttered; but he has no strength
Nor one to guide him, and his torture's more
Than man can suffer, as yourselves will see.
For lo, the palace portals are unbarred,
And soon ye shall behold a sight so sad
That he who must abhorred would pity it.
[Enter OEDIPUS blinded.]

CHORUS
          Woeful sight! more woeful none
          These sad eyes have looked upon.
          Whence this madness?  None can tell
          Who did cast on thee his spell,
          prowling all thy life around,
          Leaping with a demon bound.
          Hapless wretch! how can I brook
          On thy misery to look?
          Though to gaze on thee I yearn,
          Much to question, much to learn,
          Horror-struck away I turn.

OEDIPUS
Ah me! ah woe is me!
Ah whither am I borne!
How like a ghost forlorn
My voice flits from me on the air!
On, on the demon goads.  The end, ah where?

CHORUS
An end too dread to tell, too dark to see.

OEDIPUS
(Str. 1)
Dark, dark!  The horror of darkness, like a shroud,
Wraps me and bears me on through mist and cloud.
Ah me, ah me!  What spasms athwart me shoot,
What pangs of agonizing memory?

CHORUS
No marvel if in such a plight thou feel'st
The double weight of past and present woes.

OEDIPUS
(Ant. 1)
Ah friend, still loyal, constant still and kind,
          Thou carest for the blind.
I know thee near, and though bereft of eyes,
          Thy voice I recognize.

CHORUS
O doer of dread deeds, how couldst thou mar
Thy vision thus?  What demon goaded thee?

OEDIPUS
(Str. 2)
Apollo, friend, Apollo, he it was
          That brought these ills to pass;
But the right hand that dealt the blow
          Was mine, none other.  How,
How, could I longer see when sight
          Brought no delight?

CHORUS
Alas! 'tis as thou sayest.

OEDIPUS
Say, friends, can any look or voice
Or touch of love henceforth my heart rejoice?
          Haste, friends, no fond delay,
          Take the twice cursed away
               Far from all ken,
The man abhorred of gods, accursed of men.

CHORUS
O thy despair well suits thy desperate case.
Would I had never looked upon thy face!

OEDIPUS
(Ant. 2)
My curse on him whoe'er unrived
The waif's fell fetters and my life revived!
He meant me well, yet had he left me there,
He had saved my friends and me a world of care.

CHORUS
I too had wished it so.

OEDIPUS
Then had I never come to shed
My father's blood nor climbed my mother's bed;
The monstrous offspring of a womb defiled,
Co-mate of him who gendered me, and child.
Was ever man before afflicted thus,
Like Oedipus.

CHORUS
I cannot say that thou hast counseled well,
For thou wert better dead than living blind.

OEDIPUS
What's done was well done.  Thou canst never shake
My firm belief.  A truce to argument.
For, had I sight, I know not with what eyes
I could have met my father in the shades,
Or my poor mother, since against the twain
I sinned, a sin no gallows could atone.
Aye, but, ye say, the sight of children joys
A parent's eyes.  What, born as mine were born?
No, such a sight could never bring me joy;
Nor this fair city with its battlements,
Its temples and the statues of its gods,
Sights from which I, now wretchedst of all,
Once ranked the foremost Theban in all Thebes,
By my own sentence am cut off, condemned
By my own proclamation 'gainst the wretch,
The miscreant by heaven itself declared
Unclean--and of the race of Laius.
Thus branded as a felon by myself,
How had I dared to look you in the face?
Nay, had I known a way to choke the springs
Of hearing, I had never shrunk to make
A dungeon of this miserable frame,
Cut off from sight and hearing; for 'tis bliss
to bide in regions sorrow cannot reach.
Why didst thou harbor me, Cithaeron, why
Didst thou not take and slay me?  Then I never
Had shown to men the secret of my birth.
O Polybus, O Corinth, O my home,
Home of my ancestors (so wast thou called)
How fair a nursling then I seemed, how foul
The canker that lay festering in the bud!
Now is the blight revealed of root and fruit.
Ye triple high-roads, and thou hidden glen,
Coppice, and pass where meet the three-branched ways,
Ye drank my blood, the life-blood these hands spilt,
My father's; do ye call to mind perchance
Those deeds of mine ye witnessed and the work
I wrought thereafter when I came to Thebes?
O fatal wedlock, thou didst give me birth,
And, having borne me, sowed again my seed,
Mingling the blood of fathers, brothers, children,
Brides, wives and mothers, an incestuous brood,
All horrors that are wrought beneath the sun,
Horrors so foul to name them were unmeet.
O, I adjure you, hide me anywhere
Far from this land, or slay me straight, or cast me
Down to the depths of ocean out of sight.
Come hither, deign to touch an abject wretch;
Draw near and fear not; I myself must bear
The load of guilt that none but I can share.
[Enter CREON.]

CREON
Lo, here is Creon, the one man to grant
Thy prayer by action or advice, for he
Is left the State's sole guardian in thy stead.

OEDIPUS
Ah me! what words to accost him can I find?
What cause has he to trust me?  In the past
I have bee proved his rancorous enemy.

CREON
Not in derision, Oedipus, I come
Nor to upbraid thee with thy past misdeeds.
(To BYSTANDERS)
But shame upon you! if ye feel no sense
Of human decencies, at least revere
The Sun whose light beholds and nurtures all.
Leave not thus nakedly for all to gaze at
A horror neither earth nor rain from heaven
Nor light will suffer.  Lead him straight within,
For it is seemly that a kinsman's woes
Be heard by kin and seen by kin alone.

OEDIPUS
O listen, since thy presence comes to me
A shock of glad surprise--so noble thou,
And I so vile--O grant me one small boon.
I ask it not on my behalf, but thine.

CREON
And what the favor thou wouldst crave of me?

OEDIPUS
Forth from thy borders thrust me with all speed;
Set me within some vasty desert where
No mortal voice shall greet me any more.

CREON
This had I done already, but I deemed
It first behooved me to consult the god.

OEDIPUS
His will was set forth fully--to destroy
The parricide, the scoundrel;  and I am he.

CREON
Yea, so he spake, but in our present plight
'Twere better to consult the god anew.

OEDIPUS
Dare ye inquire concerning such a wretch?

CREON
Yea, for thyself wouldst credit now his word.

OEDIPUS
Aye, and on thee in all humility
I lay this charge:  let her who lies within
Receive such burial as thou shalt ordain;
Such rites 'tis thine, as brother, to perform.
But for myself, O never let my Thebes,
The city of my sires, be doomed to bear
The burden of my presence while I live.
No, let me be a dweller on the hills,
On yonder mount Cithaeron, famed as mine,
My tomb predestined for me by my sire
And mother, while they lived, that I may die
Slain as they sought to slay me, when alive.
This much I know full surely, nor disease
Shall end my days, nor any common chance;
For I had ne'er been snatched from death, unless
I was predestined to some awful doom.
     So be it.  I reck not how Fate deals with me
But my unhappy children--for my sons
Be not concerned, O Creon, they are men,
And for themselves, where'er they be, can fend.
But for my daughters twain, poor innocent maids,
Who ever sat beside me at the board
Sharing my viands, drinking of my cup,
For them, I pray thee, care, and, if thou willst,
O might I feel their touch and make my moan.
Hear me, O prince, my noble-hearted prince!
Could I but blindly touch them with my hands
I'd think they still were mine, as when I saw.
[ANTIGONE and ISMENE are led in.]
What say I? can it be my pretty ones
Whose sobs I hear?  Has Creon pitied me
And sent me my two darlings?  Can this be?

CREON
'Tis true; 'twas I procured thee this delight,
Knowing the joy they were to thee of old.

OEDIPUS
God speed thee! and as meed for bringing them
May Providence deal with thee kindlier
Than it has dealt with me!  O children mine,
Where are ye?  Let me clasp you with these hands,
A brother's hands, a father's; hands that made
Lack-luster sockets of his once bright eyes;
Hands of a man who blindly, recklessly,
Became your sire by her from whom he sprang.
Though I cannot behold you, I must weep
In thinking of the evil days to come,
The slights and wrongs that men will put upon you.
Where'er ye go to feast or festival,
No merrymaking will it prove for you,
But oft abashed in tears ye will return.
And when ye come to marriageable years,
Where's the bold wooers who will jeopardize
To take unto himself such disrepute
As to my children's children still must cling,
For what of infamy is lacking here?
"Their father slew his father, sowed the seed
Where he himself was gendered, and begat
These maidens at the source wherefrom he sprang."
Such are the gibes that men will cast at you.
Who then will wed you?  None, I ween, but ye
Must pine, poor maids, in single barrenness.
O Prince, Menoeceus' son, to thee, I turn,
With the it rests to father them, for we
Their natural parents, both of us, are lost.
O leave them not to wander poor, unwed,
Thy kin, nor let them share my low estate.
O pity them so young, and but for thee
All destitute.  Thy hand upon it, Prince.
To you, my children I had much to say,
Were ye but ripe to hear.  Let this suffice:
Pray ye may find some home and live content,
And may your lot prove happier than your sire's.

CREON
Thou hast had enough of weeping; pass within.

OEDIPUS
                                             I must obey,
Though 'tis grievous.

CREON
                         Weep not, everything must have its day.

OEDIPUS
Well I go, but on conditions.

CREON
                              What thy terms for going, say.

OEDIPUS
Send me from the land an exile.

CREON
                              Ask this of the gods, not me.

OEDIPUS
But I am the gods' abhorrence.

CREON
                              Then they soon will grant thy plea.

OEDIPUS
Lead me hence, then, I am willing.

CREON
                                   Come, but let thy children go.

OEDIPUS
Rob me not of these my children!

CREON
                                   Crave not mastery in all,
For the mastery that raised thee was thy bane and wrought thy fall.

CHORUS
Look ye, countrymen and Thebans, this is Oedipus the great,
He who knew the Sphinx's riddle and was mightiest in our state.
Who of all our townsmen gazed not on his fame with envious eyes?
Now, in what a sea of troubles sunk and overwhelmed he lies!
Therefore wait to see life's ending ere thou count one mortal blest;
Wait till free from pain and sorrow he has gained his final rest.

                               ARGUMENT

Oedipus, the blind and banished King of Thebes, has come in his
wanderings to Colonus, a deme of Athens, led by his daughter Antigone.
He sits to rest on a rock just within a sacred grove of the Furies and
is bidden depart by a passing native. But Oedipus, instructed by an
oracle that he had reached his final resting-place, refuses to stir, and
the stranger consents to go and consult the Elders of Colonus (the
Chorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at first the blind
beggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are horror-
striken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed
hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will
confer on the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus.
From Theseus Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil;
the benefits that will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs
having promised to aid and befriend him. No sooner has he gone than
Creon enters with an armed guard who seize Antigone and carry her off
(Ismene, the other sister, they have already captured) and he is about
to lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard the tumult, hurries
up and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to detain him
till he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the next
scene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs
Oedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon
wishes to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father's
forgiveness and blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to
the side that Oedipus espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and
invokes a dire curse on both his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of
thunder is heard, and as peal follows peal, Oedipus is aware that his
hour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus. Self-guided he leads the
way to the spot where death should overtake him, attended by Theseus and
his daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell, and what followed
none but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports) for the
gods took him.

                          OEDIPUS AT COLONUS

Enter the blind OEDIPUS led by his daughter, ANTIGONE.

OEDIPUS
Child of an old blind sire, Antigone,
What region, say, whose city have we reached?
Who will provide today with scanted dole
This wanderer?  'Tis little that he craves,
And less obtains--that less enough for me;
For I am taught by suffering to endure,
And the long years that have grown old with me,
And last not least, by true nobility.
My daughter, if thou seest a resting place
On common ground or by some sacred grove,
Stay me and set me down.  Let us discover
Where we have come, for strangers must inquire
Of denizens, and do as they are bid.

ANTIGONE
Long-suffering father, Oedipus, the towers
That fence the city still are faint and far;
But where we stand is surely holy ground;
A wilderness of laurel, olive, vine;
Within a choir or songster nightingales
Are warbling.  On this native seat of rock
Rest; for an old man thou hast traveled far.

OEDIPUS
Guide these dark steps and seat me there secure.

ANTIGONE
If time can teach, I need not to be told.

OEDIPUS
Say, prithee, if thou knowest, where we are.

ANTIGONE
Athens I recognize, but not the spot.

OEDIPUS
That much we heard from every wayfarer.

ANTIGONE
Shall I go on and ask about the place?

OEDIPUS
Yes, daughter, if it be inhabited.

ANTIGONE
Sure there are habitations; but no need
To leave thee; yonder is a man hard by.

OEDIPUS
What, moving hitherward and on his way?

ANTIGONE
Say rather, here already.  Ask him straight
The needful questions, for the man is here.
[Enter STRANGER]

OEDIPUS
O stranger, as I learn from her whose eyes
Must serve both her and me, that thou art here
Sent by some happy chance to serve our doubts--

STRANGER
First quit that seat, then question me at large:
The spot thou treadest on is holy ground.

OEDIPUS
What is the site, to what god dedicate?

STRANGER
Inviolable, untrod; goddesses,
Dread brood of Earth and Darkness, here abide.

OEDIPUS
Tell me the awful name I should invoke?

STRANGER
The Gracious Ones, All-seeing, so our folk
Call them, but elsewhere other names are rife.

OEDIPUS
Then may they show their suppliant grace, for I
From this your sanctuary will ne'er depart.

STRANGER
What word is this?

OEDIPUS
                    The watchword of my fate.

STRANGER
Nay, 'tis not mine to bid thee hence without
Due warrant and instruction from the State.

OEDIPUS
Now in God's name, O stranger, scorn me not
As a wayfarer; tell me what I crave.

STRANGER
Ask; your request shall not be scorned by me.

OEDIPUS
How call you then the place wherein we bide?

STRANGER
Whate'er I know thou too shalt know; the place
Is all to great Poseidon consecrate.
Hard by, the Titan, he who bears the torch,
Prometheus, has his worship; but the spot
Thou treadest, the Brass-footed Threshold named,
Is Athens' bastion, and the neighboring lands
Claim as their chief and patron yonder knight
Colonus, and in common bear his name.
Such, stranger, is the spot, to fame unknown,
But dear to us its native worshipers.

OEDIPUS
Thou sayest there are dwellers in these parts?

STRANGER
Surely; they bear the name of yonder god.

OEDIPUS
Ruled by a king or by the general voice?

STRANGER
The lord of Athens is our over-lord.

OEDIPUS
Who is this monarch, great in word and might?

STRANGER
Theseus, the son of Aegeus our late king.

OEDIPUS
Might one be sent from you to summon him?

STRANGER
Wherefore?  To tell him aught or urge his coming?

OEDIPUS
Say a slight service may avail him much.

STRANGER
How can he profit from a sightless man?

OEDIPUS
The blind man's words will be instinct with sight.

STRANGER
Heed then; I fain would see thee out of harm;
For by the looks, marred though they be by fate,
I judge thee noble; tarry where thou art,
While I go seek the burghers--those at hand,
Not in the city.  They will soon decide
Whether thou art to rest or go thy way.
[Exit STRANGER]

OEDIPUS
Tell me, my daughter, has the stranger gone?

ANTIGONE
Yes, he has gone; now we are all alone,
And thou may'st speak, dear father, without fear.

OEDIPUS
Stern-visaged queens, since coming to this land
First in your sanctuary I bent the knee,
Frown not on me or Phoebus, who, when erst
He told me all my miseries to come,
Spake of this respite after many years,
Some haven in a far-off land, a rest
Vouchsafed at last by dread divinities.
"There," said he, "shalt thou round thy weary life,
A blessing to the land wherein thou dwell'st,
But to the land that cast thee forth, a curse."
And of my weird he promised signs should come,
Earthquake, or thunderclap, or lightning flash.
And now I recognize as yours the sign
That led my wanderings to this your grove;
Else had I never lighted on you first,
A wineless man on your seat of native rock.
O goddesses, fulfill Apollo's word,
Grant me some consummation of my life,
If haply I appear not all too vile,
A thrall to sorrow worse than any slave.
Hear, gentle daughters of primeval Night,
Hear, namesake of great Pallas; Athens, first
Of cities, pity this dishonored shade,
The ghost of him who once was Oedipus.

ANTIGONE
Hush! for I see some grey-beards on their way,
Their errand to spy out our resting-place.

OEDIPUS
I will be mute, and thou shalt guide my steps
Into the covert from the public road,
Till I have learned their drift.  A prudent man
Will ever shape his course by what he learns.
[Enter CHORUS]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Ha!  Where is he?  Look around!
Every nook and corner scan!
He the all-presumptuous man,
Whither vanished? search the ground!
A wayfarer, I ween,
A wayfarer, no countryman of ours,
That old man must have been;
Never had native dared to tempt the Powers,
          Or enter their demesne,
The Maids in awe of whom each mortal cowers,
          Whose name no voice betrays nor cry,
          And as we pass them with averted eye,
We move hushed lips in reverent piety.
          But now some godless man,
               'Tis rumored, here abides;
          The precincts through I scan,
               Yet wot not where he hides,
                    The wretch profane!
                    I search and search in vain.

OEDIPUS
          I am that man; I know you near
          Ears to the blind, they say, are eyes.

CHORUS
          O dread to see and dread to hear!

OEDIPUS
Oh sirs, I am no outlaw under ban.

CHORUS
Who can he be--Zeus save us!--this old man?

OEDIPUS
No favorite of fate,
That ye should envy his estate,
O, Sirs, would any happy mortal, say,
Grope by the light of other eyes his way,
Or face the storm upon so frail a stay?

CHORUS
(Ant. 1)
Wast thou then sightless from thy birth?
Evil, methinks, and long
Thy pilgrimage on earth.
Yet add not curse to curse and wrong to wrong.
          I warn thee, trespass not
          Within this hallowed spot,
Lest thou shouldst find the silent grassy glade
          Where offerings are laid,
Bowls of spring water mingled with sweet mead.
          Thou must not stay,
          Come, come away,
          Tired wanderer, dost thou heed?
(We are far off, but sure our voice can reach.)
          If aught thou wouldst beseech,
Speak where 'tis right; till then refrain from speech.

OEDIPUS
Daughter, what counsel should we now pursue?

ANTIGONE
We must obey and do as here they do.

OEDIPUS
Thy hand then!

ANTIGONE
               Here, O father, is my hand,

OEDIPUS
O Sirs, if I come forth at your command,
Let me not suffer for my confidence.

CHORUS
(Str. 2)
Against thy will no man shall drive thee hence.

OEDIPUS
Shall I go further?

CHORUS
                    Aye.

OEDIPUS
                         What further still?

CHORUS
Lead maiden, thou canst guide him where we will.

ANTIGONE [4]
*       *        *        *        *        *

OEDIPUS
*       *        *        *        *        *

ANTIGONE
*       *        *        *        *        *
Follow with blind steps, father, as I lead.

OEDIPUS

*       *        *        *        *        *

CHORUS
In a strange land strange thou art;
To her will incline thy heart;
Honor whatso'er the State
Honors, all she frowns on hate.

OEDIPUS
Guide me child, where we may range
Safe within the paths of right;
Counsel freely may exchange
Nor with fate and fortune fight.

CHORUS
(Ant. 2)
Halt!  Go no further than that rocky floor.

OEDIPUS
Stay where I now am?

CHORUS
                    Yes, advance no more.

OEDIPUS
May I sit down?

CHORUS
               Move sideways towards the ledge,
And sit thee crouching on the scarped edge.

ANTIGONE
This is my office, father, O incline--

OEDIPUS
Ah me! ah me!

ANTIGONE
Thy steps to my steps, lean thine aged frame on mine.

OEDIPUS
Woe on my fate unblest!

CHORUS
Wanderer, now thou art at rest,
Tell me of thy birth and home,
From what far country art thou come,
Led on thy weary way, declare!

OEDIPUS
Strangers, I have no country.  O forbear--

CHORUS
What is it, old man, that thou wouldst conceal?

OEDIPUS
Forbear, nor urge me further to reveal--

CHORUS
Why this reluctance?

OEDIPUS
                    Dread my lineage.

CHORUS
                                        Say!

OEDIPUS
What must I answer, child, ah welladay!

CHORUS
Say of what stock thou comest, what man's son--

OEDIPUS
Ah me, my daughter, now we are undone!

ANTIGONE
Speak, for thou standest on the slippery verge.

OEDIPUS
I will; no plea for silence can I urge.

CHORUS
Will neither speak?  Come, Sir, why dally thus!

OEDIPUS
Know'st one of Laius'--

CHORUS
                         Ha?  Who!

OEDIPUS
Seed of Labdacus--

CHORUS
                    Oh Zeus!

OEDIPUS
The hapless Oedipus.

CHORUS
                    Art he?

OEDIPUS
Whate'er I utter, have no fear of me.

CHORUS
Begone!

OEDIPUS
          O wretched me!

CHORUS
                         Begone!

OEDIPUS
O daughter, what will hap anon?

CHORUS
Forth from our borders speed ye both!

OEDIPUS
How keep you then your troth?

CHORUS
Heaven's justice never smites
Him who ill with ill requites.
But if guile with guile contend,
Bane, not blessing, is the end.
Arise, begone and take thee hence straightway,
Lest on our land a heavier curse thou lay.

ANTIGONE
     O sirs! ye suffered not my father blind,
     Albeit gracious and to ruth inclined,
     Knowing the deeds he wrought, not innocent,
          But with no ill intent;
          Yet heed a maiden's moan
          Who pleads for him alone;
          My eyes, not reft of sight,
Plead with you as a daughter's might
You are our providence,
O make us not go hence!
O with a gracious nod
Grant us the nigh despaired-of boon we crave?
          Hear us, O hear,
But all that ye hold dear,
Wife, children, homestead, hearth and God!
Where will you find one, search ye ne'er so well.
Who 'scapes perdition if a god impel!

CHORUS
Surely we pity thee and him alike
Daughter of Oedipus, for your distress;
But as we reverence the decrees of Heaven
We cannot say aught other than we said.

OEDIPUS
O what avails renown or fair repute?
Are they not vanity?  For, look you, now
Athens is held of States the most devout,
Athens alone gives hospitality
And shelters the vexed stranger, so men say.
Have I found so?  I whom ye dislodged
First from my seat of rock and now would drive
Forth from your land, dreading my name alone;
For me you surely dread not, nor my deeds,
Deeds of a man more sinned against than sinning,
As I might well convince you, were it meet
To tell my mother's story and my sire's,
The cause of this your fear.  Yet am I then
A villain born because in self-defense,
Striken, I struck the striker back again?
E'en had I known, no villainy 'twould prove:
But all unwitting whither I went, I went--
To ruin; my destroyers knew it well,
Wherefore, I pray you, sirs, in Heaven's name,
Even as ye bade me quit my seat, defend me.
O pay not a lip service to the gods
And wrong them of their dues.  Bethink ye well,
The eye of Heaven beholds the just of men,
And the unjust, nor ever in this world
Has one sole godless sinner found escape.
Stand then on Heaven's side and never blot
Athens' fair scutcheon by abetting wrong.
I came to you a suppliant, and you pledged
Your honor; O preserve me to the end,
O let not this marred visage do me wrong!
A holy and god-fearing man is here
Whose coming purports comfort for your folk.
And when your chief arrives, whoe'er he be,
Then shall ye have my story and know all.
Meanwhile I pray you do me no despite.

CHORUS
The plea thou urgest, needs must give us pause,
Set forth in weighty argument, but we
Must leave the issue with the ruling powers.

OEDIPUS
Where is he, strangers, he who sways the realm?

CHORUS
In his ancestral seat; a messenger,
The same who sent us here, is gone for him.

OEDIPUS
And think you he will have such care or thought
For the blind stranger as to come himself?

CHORUS
Aye, that he will, when once he learns thy name.

OEDIPUS
But who will bear him word!

CHORUS
                              The way is long,
And many travelers pass to speed the news.
Be sure he'll hear and hasten, never fear;
So wide and far thy name is noised abroad,
That, were he ne'er so spent and loth to move,
He would bestir him when he hears of thee.

OEDIPUS
Well, may he come with blessing to his State
And me!  Who serves his neighbor serves himself. [5]

ANTIGONE
Zeus!  What is this?  What can I say or think?

OEDIPUS
What now, Antigone?

ANTIGONE
                    I see a woman
Riding upon a colt of Aetna's breed;
She wears for headgear a Thessalian hat
To shade her from the sun.  Who can it be?
She or a stranger?  Do I wake or dream?
'This she; 'tis not--I cannot tell, alack;
It is no other!  Now her bright'ning glance
Greets me with recognition, yes, 'tis she,
Herself, Ismene!

OEDIPUS
                    Ha! what say ye, child?

ANTIGONE
That I behold thy daughter and my sister,
And thou wilt know her straightway by her voice.
[Enter ISMENE]

ISMENE
Father and sister, names to me most sweet,
How hardly have I found you, hardly now
When found at last can see you through my tears!

OEDIPUS
Art come, my child?

ISMENE
                    O father, sad thy plight!

OEDIPUS
Child, thou art here?

ISMENE
                    Yes, 'twas a weary way.

OEDIPUS
Touch me, my child.

ISMENE
                    I give a hand to both.

OEDIPUS
O children--sisters!

ISMENE
                    O disastrous plight!

OEDIPUS
Her plight and mine?

ISMENE
                    Aye, and my own no less.

OEDIPUS
What brought thee, daughter?

ISMENE
                              Father, care for thee.

OEDIPUS
A daughter's yearning?

ISMENE
                         Yes, and I had news
I would myself deliver, so I came
With the one thrall who yet is true to me.

OEDIPUS
Thy valiant brothers, where are they at need?

ISMENE
They are--enough, 'tis now their darkest hour.

OEDIPUS
Out on the twain!  The thoughts and actions all
Are framed and modeled on Egyptian ways.
For there the men sit at the loom indoors
While the wives slave abroad for daily bread.
So you, my children--those whom I behooved
To bear the burden, stay at home like girls,
While in their stead my daughters moil and drudge,
Lightening their father's misery.  The one
Since first she grew from girlish feebleness
To womanhood has been the old man's guide
And shared my weary wandering, roaming oft
Hungry and footsore through wild forest ways,
In drenching rains and under scorching suns,
Careless herself of home and ease, if so
Her sire might have her tender ministry.
And thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,
Eluding the Cadmeians' vigilance,
To bring thy father all the oracles
Concerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself
My faithful lieger, when they banished me.
And now what mission summons thee from home,
What news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?
This much I know, thou com'st not empty-handed,
Without a warning of some new alarm.

ISMENE
The toil and trouble, father, that I bore
To find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,
I spare thee; surely 'twere a double pain
To suffer, first in act and then in telling;
'Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons
I come to tell thee.  At the first they willed
To leave the throne to Creon, minded well
Thus to remove the inveterate curse of old,
A canker that infected all thy race.
But now some god and an infatuate soul
Have stirred betwixt them a mad rivalry
To grasp at sovereignty and kingly power.
Today the hot-branded youth, the younger born,
Is keeping Polyneices from the throne,
His elder, and has thrust him from the land.
The banished brother (so all Thebes reports)
Fled to the vale of Argos, and by help
Of new alliance there and friends in arms,
Swears he will stablish Argos straight as lord
Of the Cadmeian land, or, if he fail,
Exalt the victor to the stars of heaven.
This is no empty tale, but deadly truth,
My father; and how long thy agony,
Ere the gods pity thee, I cannot tell.

OEDIPUS
Hast thou indeed then entertained a hope
The gods at last will turn and rescue me?

ISMENE
Yea, so I read these latest oracles.

OEDIPUS
What oracles?  What hath been uttered, child?

ISMENE
Thy country (so it runs) shall yearn in time
To have thee for their weal alive or dead.

OEDIPUS
And who could gain by such a one as I?

ISMENE
On thee, 'tis said, their sovereignty depends.

OEDIPUS
So, when I cease to be, my worth begins.

ISMENE
The gods, who once abased, uplift thee now.

OEDIPUS
Poor help to raise an old man fallen in youth.

ISMENE
Howe'er that be, 'tis for this cause alone
That Creon comes to thee--and comes anon.

OEDIPUS
With what intent, my daughter?  Tell me plainly.

ISMENE
To plant thee near the Theban land, and so
Keep thee within their grasp, yet now allow
Thy foot to pass beyond their boundaries.

OEDIPUS
What gain they, if I lay outside?

OEDIPUS
                                   Thy tomb,
If disappointed, brings on them a curse.

OEDIPUS
It needs no god to tell what's plain to sense.

ISMENE
Therefore they fain would have thee close at hand,
Not where thou wouldst be master of thyself.

OEDIPUS
Mean they to shroud my bones in Theban dust?

ISMENE
Nay, father, guilt of kinsman's blood forbids.

OEDIPUS
Then never shall they be my masters, never!

ISMENE
Thebes, thou shalt rue this bitterly some day!

OEDIPUS
When what conjunction comes to pass, my child?

ISMENE
Thy angry wraith, when at thy tomb they stand. [6]

OEDIPUS
And who hath told thee what thou tell'st me, child?

ISMENE
Envoys who visited the Delphic hearth.

OEDIPUS
Hath Phoebus spoken thus concerning me?

ISMENE
So say the envoys who returned to Thebes.

OEDIPUS
And can a son of mine have heard of this?

ISMENE
Yea, both alike, and know its import well.

OEDIPUS
They knew it, yet the ignoble greed of rule
Outweighed all longing for their sire's return.

ISMENE
Grievous thy words, yet I must own them true.

OEDIPUS
Then may the gods ne'er quench their fatal feud,
And mine be the arbitrament of the fight,
For which they now are arming, spear to spear;
That neither he who holds the scepter now
May keep this throne, nor he who fled the realm
Return again.  _They_ never raised a hand,
When I their sire was thrust from hearth and home,
When I was banned and banished, what recked they?
Say you 'twas done at my desire, a grace
Which the state, yielding to my wish, allowed?
Not so; for, mark you, on that very day
When in the tempest of my soul I craved
Death, even death by stoning, none appeared
To further that wild longing, but anon,
When time had numbed my anguish and I felt
My wrath had all outrun those errors past,
Then, then it was the city went about
By force to oust me, respited for years;
And then my sons, who should as sons have helped,
Did nothing: and, one little word from them
Was all I needed, and they spoke no word,
But let me wander on for evermore,
A banished man, a beggar.  These two maids
Their sisters, girls, gave all their sex could give,
Food and safe harborage and filial care;
While their two brethren sacrificed their sire
For lust of power and sceptred sovereignty.
No! me they ne'er shall win for an ally,
Nor will this Theban kingship bring them gain;
That know I from this maiden's oracles,
And those old prophecies concerning me,
Which Phoebus now at length has brought to pass.
Come Creon then, come all the mightiest
In Thebes to seek me; for if ye my friends,
Championed by those dread Powers indigenous,
Espouse my cause; then for the State ye gain
A great deliverer, for my foemen bane.

CHORUS
Our pity, Oedipus, thou needs must move,
Thou and these maidens; and the stronger plea
Thou urgest, as the savior of our land,
Disposes me to counsel for thy weal.

OEDIPUS
Aid me, kind sirs; I will do all you bid.

CHORUS
First make atonement to the deities,
Whose grove by trespass thou didst first profane.

OEDIPUS
After what manner, stranger?  Teach me, pray.

CHORUS
Make a libation first of water fetched
With undefiled hands from living spring.

OEDIPUS
And after I have gotten this pure draught?

CHORUS
Bowls thou wilt find, the carver's handiwork;
Crown thou the rims and both the handles crown--

OEDIPUS
With olive shoots or blocks of wool, or how?

CHORUS
With wool from fleece of yearling freshly shorn.

OEDIPUS
What next? how must I end the ritual?

CHORUS
Pour thy libation, turning to the dawn.

OEDIPUS
Pouring it from the urns whereof ye spake?

CHORUS
Yea, in three streams; and be the last bowl drained
To the last drop.

OEDIPUS
                    And wherewith shall I fill it,
Ere in its place I set it?  This too tell.

CHORUS
With water and with honey; add no wine.

OEDIPUS
And when the embowered earth hath drunk thereof?

CHORUS
Then lay upon it thrice nine olive sprays
With both thy hands, and offer up this prayer.

OEDIPUS
I fain would hear it; that imports the most.

CHORUS
That, as we call them Gracious, they would deign
To grant the suppliant their saving grace.
So pray thyself or whoso pray for thee,
In whispered accents, not with lifted voice;
Then go and look back.  Do as I bid,
And I shall then be bold to stand thy friend;
Else, stranger, I should have my fears for thee.

OEDIPUS
Hear ye, my daughters, what these strangers say?

ANTIGONE
We listened, and attend thy bidding, father.

OEDIPUS
I cannot go, disabled as I am
Doubly, by lack of strength and lack of sight;
But one of you may do it in my stead;
For one, I trow, may pay the sacrifice
Of thousands, if his heart be leal and true.
So to your work with speed, but leave me not
Untended; for this frame is all too week
To move without the help of guiding hand.

ISMENE
Then I will go perform these rites, but where
To find the spot, this have I yet to learn.

CHORUS
Beyond this grove; if thou hast need of aught,
The guardian of the close will lend his aid.

ISMENE
I go, and thou, Antigone, meanwhile
Must guard our father.  In a parent's cause
Toil, if there be toil, is of no account.
[Exit ISMENE]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Ill it is, stranger, to awake
Pain that long since has ceased to ache,
And yet I fain would hear--

OEDIPUS
What thing?

CHORUS
Thy tale of cruel suffering
For which no cure was found,
The fate that held thee bound.

OEDIPUS
O bid me not (as guest I claim
This grace) expose my shame.

CHORUS
The tale is bruited far and near,
And echoes still from ear to ear.
The truth, I fain would hear.

OEDIPUS
Ah me!

CHORUS
     I prithee yield.

OEDIPUS
                    Ah me!

CHORUS
Grant my request, I granted all to thee.

OEDIPUS
(Ant. 1)
Know then I suffered ills most vile, but none
(So help me Heaven!) from acts in malice done.

CHORUS
Say how.

OEDIPUS
          The State around
An all unwitting bridegroom bound
An impious marriage chain;
          That was my bane.

CHORUS
Didst thou in sooth then share
A bed incestuous with her that bare--

OEDIPUS
It stabs me like a sword,
That two-edged word,
O stranger, but these maids--my own--

CHORUS
Say on.

OEDIPUS
Two daughters, curses twain.

CHORUS
Oh God!

OEDIPUS
Sprang from the wife and mother's travail-pain.

CHORUS
(Str. 2)
What, then thy offspring are at once--

OEDIPUS
                                        Too true.
Their father's very sister's too.

CHORUS
Oh horror!

OEDIPUS
          Horrors from the boundless deep
Back on my soul in refluent surges sweep.

CHORUS
Thou hast endured--

OEDIPUS
                    Intolerable woe.

CHORUS
And sinned--

OEDIPUS
               I sinned not.

CHORUS
                              How so?

OEDIPUS
I served the State; would I had never won
That graceless grace by which I was undone.

CHORUS
(Ant. 2)
And next, unhappy man, thou hast shed blood?

OEDIPUS
Must ye hear more?

CHORUS
                    A father's?

OEDIPUS
                                   Flood on flood
Whelms me; that word's a second mortal blow.

CHORUS
Murderer!

OEDIPUS
          Yes, a murderer, but know--

CHORUS
What canst thou plead?

OEDIPUS
                         A plea of justice.

CHORUS
                                             How?

OEDIPUS
I slew who else would me have slain;
I slew without intent,
A wretch, but innocent
In the law's eye, I stand, without a stain.

CHORUS
Behold our sovereign, Theseus, Aegeus' son,
Comes at thy summons to perform his part.
[Enter THESEUS]

THESEUS
Oft had I heard of thee in times gone by--
The bloody mutilation of thine eyes--
And therefore know thee, son of Laius.
All that I lately gathered on the way
Made my conjecture doubly sure; and now
Thy garb and that marred visage prove to me
That thou art he.  So pitying thine estate,
Most ill-starred Oedipus, I fain would know
What is the suit ye urge on me and Athens,
Thou and the helpless maiden at thy side.
Declare it; dire indeed must be the tale
Whereat _I_ should recoil.  I too was reared,
Like thee, in exile, and in foreign lands
Wrestled with many perils, no man more.
Wherefore no alien in adversity
Shall seek in vain my succor, nor shalt thou;
I know myself a mortal, and my share
In what the morrow brings no more than thine.

OEDIPUS
Theseus, thy words so apt, so generous
So comfortable, need no long reply
Both who I am and of what lineage sprung,
And from what land I came, thou hast declared.
So without prologue I may utter now
My brief petition, and the tale is told.

THESEUS
Say on, and tell me what I fain would learn.

OEDIPUS
I come to offer thee this woe-worn frame,
A gift not fair to look on; yet its worth
More precious far than any outward show.

THESEUS
What profit dost thou proffer to have brought?

OEDIPUS
Hereafter thou shalt learn, not yet, methinks.

THESEUS
When may we hope to reap the benefit?

OEDIPUS
When I am dead and thou hast buried me.

THESEUS
Thou cravest life's last service; all before--
Is it forgotten or of no account?

OEDIPUS
Yea, the last boon is warrant for the rest.

THESEUS
The grace thou cravest then is small indeed.

OEDIPUS
Nay, weigh it well; the issue is not slight.

THESEUS
Thou meanest that betwixt thy sons and me?

OEDIPUS
Prince, they would fain convey me back to Thebes.

THESEUS
If there be no compulsion, then methinks
To rest in banishment befits not thee.

OEDIPUS
Nay, when _I_ wished it _they_ would not consent.

THESEUS
For shame! such temper misbecomes the faller.

OEDIPUS
Chide if thou wilt, but first attend my plea.

THESEUS
Say on, I wait full knowledge ere I judge.

OEDIPUS
O Theseus, I have suffered wrongs on wrongs.

THESEUS
Wouldst tell the old misfortune of thy race?

OEDIPUS
No, that has grown a byword throughout Greece.

THESEUS
What then can be this more than mortal grief?

OEDIPUS
My case stands thus; by my own flesh and blood
I was expelled my country, and can ne'er
Thither return again, a parricide.

THESEUS
Why fetch thee home if thou must needs obey.

THESEUS
What are they threatened by the oracle?

OEDIPUS
Destruction that awaits them in this land.

THESEUS
What can beget ill blood 'twixt them and me?

OEDIPUS
Dear son of Aegeus, to the gods alone
Is given immunity from eld and death;
But nothing else escapes all-ruinous time.
Earth's might decays, the might of men decays,
Honor grows cold, dishonor flourishes,
There is no constancy 'twixt friend and friend,
Or city and city; be it soon or late,
Sweet turns to bitter, hate once more to love.
If now 'tis sunshine betwixt Thebes and thee
And not a cloud, Time in his endless course
Gives birth to endless days and nights, wherein
The merest nothing shall suffice to cut
With serried spears your bonds of amity.
Then shall my slumbering and buried corpse
In its cold grave drink their warm life-blood up,
If Zeus be Zeus and Phoebus still speak true.
No more:  'tis ill to tear aside the veil
Of mysteries; let me cease as I began:
Enough if thou wilt keep thy plighted troth,
Then shall thou ne'er complain that Oedipus
Proved an unprofitable and thankless guest,
Except the gods themselves shall play me false.

CHORUS
The man, my lord, has from the very first
Declared his power to offer to our land
These and like benefits.

THESEUS
                         Who could reject
The proffered amity of such a friend?
First, he can claim the hospitality
To which by mutual contract we stand pledged:
Next, coming here, a suppliant to the gods,
He pays full tribute to the State and me;
His favors therefore never will I spurn,
But grant him the full rights of citizen;
And, if it suits the stranger here to bide,
I place him in your charge, or if he please
Rather to come with me--choose, Oedipus,
Which of the two thou wilt.  Thy choice is mine.

OEDIPUS
Zeus, may the blessing fall on men like these!

THESEUS
What dost thou then decide--to come with me?

OEDIPUS
Yea, were it lawful--but 'tis rather here--

THESEUS
What wouldst thou here?  I shall not thwart thy wish.

OEDIPUS
Here shall I vanquish those who cast me forth.

THESEUS
Then were thy presence here a boon indeed.

OEDIPUS
Such shall it prove, if thou fulfill'st thy pledge.

THESEUS
Fear not for me; I shall not play thee false.

OEDIPUS
No need to back thy promise with an oath.

THESEUS
An oath would be no surer than my word.

OEDIPUS
How wilt thou act then?

THESEUS
                         What is it thou fear'st?

OEDIPUS
My foes will come--

THESEUS
                    Our friends will look to that.

OEDIPUS
But if thou leave me?

THESEUS
                    Teach me not my duty.

OEDIPUS
'Tis fear constrains me.

THESEUS
                         _My_ soul knows no fear!

OEDIPUS
Thou knowest not what threats--

THESEUS
                              I know that none
Shall hale thee hence in my despite.  Such threats
Vented in anger oft, are blusterers,
An idle breath, forgot when sense returns.
And for thy foemen, though their words were brave,
Boasting to bring thee back, they are like to find
The seas between us wide and hard to sail.
Such my firm purpose, but in any case
Take heart, since Phoebus sent thee here.  My name,
Though I be distant, warrants thee from harm.

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
     Thou hast come to a steed-famed land for rest,
          O stranger worn with toil,
     To a land of all lands the goodliest
          Colonus' glistening soil.
     'Tis the haunt of the clear-voiced nightingale,
          Who hid in her bower, among
     The wine-dark ivy that wreathes the vale,
          Trilleth her ceaseless song;
     And she loves, where the clustering berries nod
          O'er a sunless, windless glade,
     The spot by no mortal footstep trod,
     The pleasance kept for the Bacchic god,
     Where he holds each night his revels wild
     With the nymphs who fostered the lusty child.

(Ant. 1)
     And fed each morn by the pearly dew
          The starred narcissi shine,
     And a wreath with the crocus' golden hue
          For the Mother and Daughter twine.
     And never the sleepless fountains cease
          That feed Cephisus' stream,
     But they swell earth's bosom with quick increase,
          And their wave hath a crystal gleam.
     And the Muses' quire will never disdain
     To visit this heaven-favored plain,
     Nor the Cyprian queen of the golden rein.

(Str. 2)
     And here there grows, unpruned, untamed,
          Terror to foemen's spear,
     A tree in Asian soil unnamed,
     By Pelops' Dorian isle unclaimed,
          Self-nurtured year by year;
     'Tis the grey-leaved olive that feeds our boys;
     Nor youth nor withering age destroys
     The plant that the Olive Planter tends
     And the Grey-eyed Goddess herself defends.

(Ant. 2)
     Yet another gift, of all gifts the most
     Prized by our fatherland, we boast--
     The might of the horse, the might of the sea;
     Our fame, Poseidon, we owe to thee,
     Son of Kronos, our king divine,
     Who in these highways first didst fit
     For the mouth of horses the iron bit;
     Thou too hast taught us to fashion meet
     For the arm of the rower the oar-blade fleet,
     Swift as the Nereids' hundred feet
     As they dance along the brine.

ANTIGONE
Oh land extolled above all lands, 'tis now
For thee to make these glorious titles good.

OEDIPUS
Why this appeal, my daughter?

ANTIGONE
                              Father, lo!
Creon approaches with his company.

OEDIPUS
Fear not, it shall be so; if we are old,
This country's vigor has no touch of age.
[Enter CREON with attendants]

CREON
Burghers, my noble friends, ye take alarm
At my approach (I read it in your eyes),
Fear nothing and refrain from angry words.
I come with no ill purpose; I am old,
And know the city whither I am come,
Without a peer amongst the powers of Greece.
It was by reason of my years that I
Was chosen to persuade your guest and bring
Him back to Thebes; not the delegate
Of one man, but commissioned by the State,
Since of all Thebans I have most bewailed,
Being his kinsman, his most grievous woes.
O listen to me, luckless Oedipus,
Come home!  The whole Cadmeian people claim
With right to have thee back, I most of all,
For most of all (else were I vile indeed)
I mourn for thy misfortunes, seeing thee
An aged outcast, wandering on and on,
A beggar with one handmaid for thy stay.
Ah! who had e'er imagined she could fall
To such a depth of misery as this,
To tend in penury thy stricken frame,
A virgin ripe for wedlock, but unwed,
A prey for any wanton ravisher?
Seems it not cruel this reproach I cast
On thee and on myself and all the race?
Aye, but an open shame cannot be hid.
Hide it, O hide it, Oedipus, thou canst.
O, by our fathers' gods, consent I pray;
Come back to Thebes, come to thy father's home,
Bid Athens, as is meet, a fond farewell;
Thebes thy old foster-mother claims thee first.

OEDIPUS
O front of brass, thy subtle tongue would twist
To thy advantage every plea of right
Why try thy arts on me, why spread again
Toils where 'twould gall me sorest to be snared?
In old days when by self-wrought woes distraught,
I yearned for exile as a glad release,
Thy will refused the favor then I craved.
But when my frenzied grief had spent its force,
And I was fain to taste the sweets of home,
Then thou wouldst thrust me from my country, then
These ties of kindred were by thee ignored;
And now again when thou behold'st this State
And all its kindly people welcome me,
Thou seek'st to part us, wrapping in soft words
Hard thoughts.  And yet what pleasure canst thou find
In forcing friendship on unwilling foes?
Suppose a man refused to grant some boon
When you importuned him, and afterwards
When you had got your heart's desire, consented,
Granting a grace from which all grace had fled,
Would not such favor seem an empty boon?
Yet such the boon thou profferest now to me,
Fair in appearance, but when tested false.
Yea, I will proved thee false, that these may hear;
Thou art come to take me, not to take me home,
But plant me on thy borders, that thy State
May so escape annoyance from this land.
_That_ thou shalt never gain, but _this_ instead--
My ghost to haunt thy country without end;
And for my sons, this heritage--no more--
Just room to die in.  Have not I more skill
Than thou to draw the horoscope of Thebes?
Are not my teachers surer guides than thine--
Great Phoebus and the sire of Phoebus, Zeus?
Thou art a messenger suborned, thy tongue
Is sharper than a sword's edge, yet thy speech
Will bring thee more defeats than victories.
Howbeit, I know I waste my words--begone,
And leave me here; whate'er may be my lot,
He lives not ill who lives withal content.

CREON
Which loses in this parley, I o'erthrown
By thee, or thou who overthrow'st thyself?

OEDIPUS
I shall be well contented if thy suit
Fails with these strangers, as it has with me.

CREON
Unhappy man, will years ne'er make thee wise?
Must thou live on to cast a slur on age?

OEDIPUS
Thou hast a glib tongue, but no honest man,
Methinks, can argue well on any side.

CREON
'Tis one thing to speak much, another well.

OEDIPUS
Thy words, forsooth, are few and all well aimed!

CREON
Not for a man indeed with wits like thine.

OEDIPUS
Depart!  I bid thee in these burghers' name,
And prowl no longer round me to blockade
My destined harbor.

CREON
                    I protest to these,
Not thee, and for thine answer to thy kin,
If e'er I take thee--

OEDIPUS
                    Who against their will
Could take me?

CREON
               Though untaken thou shalt smart.

OEDIPUS
What power hast thou to execute this threat?

CREON
One of thy daughters is already seized,
The other I will carry off anon.

OEDIPUS
Woe, woe!

CREON
          This is but prelude to thy woes.

OEDIPUS
Hast thou my child?

CREON
                    And soon shall have the other.

OEDIPUS
Ho, friends! ye will not surely play me false?
Chase this ungodly villain from your land.

CHORUS
Hence, stranger, hence avaunt!  Thou doest wrong
In this, and wrong in all that thou hast done.

CREON (to his guards)
'Tis time by force to carry off the girl,
If she refuse of her free will to go.

ANTIGONE
Ah, woe is me! where shall I fly, where find
Succor from gods or men?

CHORUS
                         What would'st thou, stranger?

CREON
I meddle not with him, but her who is mine.

OEDIPUS
O princes of the land!

CHORUS
                         Sir, thou dost wrong.

CREON
Nay, right.

CHORUS
               How right?

CREON
                         I take but what is mine.

OEDIPUS
Help, Athens!

CHORUS
What means this, sirrah? quick unhand her, or
We'll fight it out.

CREON
                    Back!

CHORUS
                         Not till thou forbear.

CREON
'Tis war with Thebes if I am touched or harmed.

OEDIPUS
Did I not warn thee?

CHORUS
                    Quick, unhand the maid!

CREON
Command your minions; I am not your slave.

CHORUS
Desist, I bid thee.

CREON (to the guard)
                    And O bid thee march!

CHORUS
          To the rescue, one and all!
          Rally, neighbors to my call!
          See, the foe is at the gate!
          Rally to defend the State.

ANTIGONE
Ah, woe is me, they drag me hence, O friends.

OEDIPUS
Where art thou, daughter?

ANTIGONE
                         Haled along by force.

OEDIPUS
Thy hands, my child!

ANTIGONE
                    They will not let me, father.

CREON
Away with her!

OEDIPUS
               Ah, woe is me, ah woe!

CREON
So those two crutches shall no longer serve thee
For further roaming.  Since it pleaseth thee
To triumph o'er thy country and thy friends
Who mandate, though a prince, I here discharge,
Enjoy thy triumph; soon or late thou'lt find
Thou art an enemy to thyself, both now
And in time past, when in despite of friends
Thou gav'st the rein to passion, still thy bane.

CHORUS
Hold there, sir stranger!

CREON
                         Hands off, have a care.

CHORUS
Restore the maidens, else thou goest not.

CREON
Then Thebes will take a dearer surety soon;
I will lay hands on more than these two maids.

CHORUS
What canst thou further?

CREON
                         Carry off this man.

CHORUS
Brave words!

CREON
               And deeds forthwith shall make them good.

CHORUS
Unless perchance our sovereign intervene.

OEDIPUS
O shameless voice!  Would'st lay an hand on me?

CREON
Silence, I bid thee!

OEDIPUS
                    Goddesses, allow
Thy suppliant to utter yet one curse!
Wretch, now my eyes are gone thou hast torn away
The helpless maiden who was eyes to me;
For these to thee and all thy cursed race
May the great Sun, whose eye is everywhere,
Grant length of days and old age like to mine.

CREON
Listen, O men of Athens, mark ye this?

OEDIPUS
They mark us both and understand that I
Wronged by the deeds defend myself with words.

CREON
Nothing shall curb my will; though I be old
And single-handed, I will have this man.

OEDIPUS
O woe is me!

CHORUS
Thou art a bold man, stranger, if thou think'st
To execute thy purpose.

CREON
                         So I do.

CHORUS
Then shall I deem this State no more a State.

CREON
With a just quarrel weakness conquers might.

OEDIPUS
Ye hear his words?

CHORUS
                    Aye words, but not yet deeds,
Zeus knoweth!

CREON
               Zeus may haply know, not thou.

CHORUS
Insolence!

CREON
          Insolence that thou must bear.

CHORUS
          Haste ye princes, sound the alarm!
          Men of Athens, arm ye, arm!
          Quickly to the rescue come
          Ere the robbers get them home.
[Enter THESEUS]

THESEUS
Why this outcry?  What is forward? wherefore was I called away
From the altar of Poseidon, lord of your Colonus?  Say!
On what errand have I hurried hither without stop or stay.

OEDIPUS
Dear friend--those accents tell me who thou art--
Yon man but now hath done me a foul wrong.

THESEUS
What is this wrong and who hath wrought it?  Speak.

OEDIPUS
Creon who stands before thee.  He it is
Hath robbed me of my all, my daughters twain.

THESEUS
What means this?

OEDIPUS
               Thou hast heard my tale of wrongs.

THESEUS
Ho! hasten to the altars, one of you.
Command my liegemen leave the sacrifice
And hurry, foot and horse, with rein unchecked,
To where the paths that packmen use diverge,
Lest the two maidens slip away, and I
Become a mockery to this my guest,
As one despoiled by force.  Quick, as I bid.
As for this stranger, had I let my rage,
Justly provoked, have play, he had not 'scaped
Scathless and uncorrected at my hands.
But now the laws to which himself appealed,
These and none others shall adjudicate.
Thou shalt not quit this land, till thou hast fetched
The maidens and produced them in my sight.
Thou hast offended both against myself
And thine own race and country.  Having come
Unto a State that champions right and asks
For every action warranty of law,
Thou hast set aside the custom of the land,
And like some freebooter art carrying off
What plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth
Thou thoughtest this a city without men,
Or manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.
Yet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;
Thebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,
Nor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou
Wert robbing me--aye and the gods to boot,
Haling by force their suppliants, poor maids.
Were I on Theban soil, to prosecute
The justest claim imaginable, I
Would never wrest by violence my own
Without sanction of your State or King;
I should behave as fits an outlander
Living amongst a foreign folk, but thou
Shamest a city that deserves it not,
Even thine own, and plentitude of years
Have made of thee an old man and a fool.
Therefore again I charge thee as before,
See that the maidens are restored at once,
Unless thou would'st continue here by force
And not by choice a sojourner; so much
I tell thee home and what I say, I mean.

CHORUS
Thy case is perilous; though by birth and race
Thou should'st be just, thou plainly doest wrong.

CREON
Not deeming this city void of men
Or counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say'st
I did what I have done; rather I thought
Your people were not like to set such store
by kin of mine and keep them 'gainst my will.
Nor would they harbor, so I stood assured,
A godless parricide, a reprobate
Convicted of incestuous marriage ties.
For on her native hill of Ares here
(I knew your far-famed Areopagus)
Sits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk
To stay within your borders.  In that faith
I hunted down my quarry; and e'en then
I had refrained but for the curses dire
Wherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:
Such wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.
Anger has no old age but only death;
The dead alone can feel no touch of spite.
So thou must work thy will; my cause is just
But weak without allies; yet will I try,
Old as I am, to answer deeds with deeds.

OEDIPUS
O shameless railer, think'st thou this abuse
Defames my grey hairs rather than thine own?
Murder and incest, deeds of horror, all
Thou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,
No willing sinner; so it pleased the gods
Wrath haply with my sinful race of old,
Since thou could'st find no sin in me myself
For which in retribution I was doomed
To trespass thus against myself and mine.
Answer me now, if by some oracle
My sire was destined to a bloody end
By a son's hand, can this reflect on me,
Me then unborn, begotten by no sire,
Conceived in no mother's womb?  And if
When born to misery, as born I was,
I met my sire, not knowing whom I met
or what I did, and slew him, how canst thou
With justice blame the all-unconscious hand?
And for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,
Seeing she was thy sister, to extort
From me the story of her marriage, such
A marriage as I straightway will proclaim.
For I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech
Has broken all the bonds of reticence.
She was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;
I knew it not, nor she; and she my mother
Bare children to the son whom she had borne,
A birth of shame.  But this at least I know
Wittingly thou aspersest her and me;
But I unwitting wed, unwilling speak.
Nay neither in this marriage or this deed
Which thou art ever casting in my teeth--
A murdered sire--shall I be held to blame.
Come, answer me one question, if thou canst:
If one should presently attempt thy life,
Would'st thou, O man of justice, first inquire
If the assassin was perchance thy sire,
Or turn upon him?  As thou lov'st thy life,
On thy aggressor thou would'st turn, no stay
Debating, if the law would bear thee out.
Such was my case, and such the pass whereto
The gods reduced me; and methinks my sire,
Could he come back to life, would not dissent.
Yet thou, for just thou art not, but a man
Who sticks at nothing, if it serve his plea,
Reproachest me with this before these men.
It serves thy turn to laud great Theseus' name,
And Athens as a wisely governed State;
Yet in thy flatteries one thing is to seek:
If any land knows how to pay the gods
Their proper rites, 'tis Athens most of all.
This is the land whence thou wast fain to steal
Their aged suppliant and hast carried off
My daughters.  Therefore to yon goddesses,
I turn, adjure them and invoke their aid
To champion my cause, that thou mayest learn
What is the breed of men who guard this State.

CHORUS
An honest man, my liege, one sore bestead
By fortune, and so worthy our support.

THESEUS
Enough of words; the captors speed amain,
While we the victims stand debating here.

CREON
What would'st thou?  What can I, a feeble man?

THESEUS
Show us the trail, and I'll attend thee too,
That, if thou hast the maidens hereabouts,
Thou mayest thyself discover them to me;
But if thy guards outstrip us with their spoil,
We may draw rein; for others speed, from whom
They will not 'scape to thank the gods at home.
Lead on, I say, the captor's caught, and fate
Hath ta'en the fowler in the toils he spread;
So soon are lost gains gotten by deceit.
And look not for allies; I know indeed
Such height of insolence was never reached
Without abettors or accomplices;
Thou hast some backer in thy bold essay,
But I will search this matter home and see
One man doth not prevail against the State.
Dost take my drift, or seem these words as vain
As seemed our warnings when the plot was hatched?

CREON
Nothing thou sayest can I here dispute,
But once at home I too shall act my part.

THESEUS
Threaten us and--begone!  Thou, Oedipus,
Stay here assured that nothing save my death
Will stay my purpose to restore the maids.

OEDIPUS
Heaven bless thee, Theseus, for thy nobleness
And all thy loving care in my behalf.
[Exeunt THESEUS and CREON]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
          O when the flying foe,
          Turning at last to bay,
          Soon will give blow for blow,
          Might I behold the fray;
          Hear the loud battle roar
          Swell, on the Pythian shore,
          Or by the torch-lit bay,
          Where the dread Queen and Maid
          Cherish the mystic rites,
          Rites they to none betray,
          Ere on his lips is laid
          Secrecy's golden key
          By their own acolytes,
          Priestly Eumolpidae.

          There I might chance behold
          Theseus our captain bold
          Meet with the robber band,
          Ere they have fled the land,
          Rescue by might and main
          Maidens, the captives twain.

(Ant. 1)
          Haply on swiftest steed,
          Or in the flying car,
          Now they approach the glen,
          West of white Oea's scaur.
          They will be vanquished:
          Dread are our warriors, dread
          Theseus our chieftain's men.
          Flashes each bridle bright,
          Charges each gallant knight,
          All that our Queen adore,
          Pallas their patron, or
          Him whose wide floods enring
          Earth, the great Ocean-king
          Whom Rhea bore.

(Str. 2)
          Fight they or now prepare
          To fight? a vision rare
          Tells me that soon again
          I shall behold the twain
          Maidens so ill bestead,
          By their kin buffeted.
Today, today Zeus worketh some great thing
     This day shall victory bring.
O for the wings, the wings of a dove,
To be borne with the speed of the gale,
Up and still upwards to sail
     And gaze on the fray from the clouds above.
(Ant. 2)
All-seeing Zeus, O lord of heaven,
To our guardian host be given
Might triumphant to surprise
Flying foes and win their prize.
Hear us, Zeus, and hear us, child
Of Zeus, Athene undefiled,
Hear, Apollo, hunter, hear,
Huntress, sister of Apollo,
Who the dappled swift-foot deer
O'er the wooded glade dost follow;
Help with your two-fold power
Athens in danger's hour!
O wayfarer, thou wilt not have to tax
The friends who watch for thee with false presage,
For lo, an escort with the maids draws near.
[Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE with THESEUS]

OEDIPUS
Where, where? what sayest thou?

ANTIGONE
                              O father, father,
Would that some god might grant thee eyes to see
This best of men who brings us back again.

OEDIPUS
My child! and are ye back indeed!

ANTIGONE
                                   Yes, saved
By Theseus and his gallant followers.

OEDIPUS
Come to your father's arms, O let me feel
A child's embrace I never hoped for more.

ANTIGONE
Thou askest what is doubly sweet to give.

OEDIPUS
Where are ye then?

ANTIGONE
                    We come together both.

OEDIPUS
My precious nurslings!

ANTIGONE
                         Fathers aye were fond.

OEDIPUS
Props of my age!

ANTIGONE
               So sorrow sorrow props.

OEDIPUS
I have my darlings, and if death should come,
Death were not wholly bitter with you near.
Cling to me, press me close on either side,
There rest ye from your dreary wayfaring.
Now tell me of your ventures, but in brief;
Brief speech suffices for young maids like you.

ANTIGONE
Here is our savior; thou should'st hear the tale
From his own lips; so shall my part be brief.

OEDIPUS
I pray thee do not wonder if the sight
Of children, given o'er for lost, has made
My converse somewhat long and tedious.
Full well I know the joy I have of them
Is due to thee, to thee and no man else;
Thou wast their sole deliverer, none else.
The gods deal with thee after my desire,
With thee and with this land! for fear of heaven
I found above all peoples most with you,
And righteousness and lips that cannot lie.
I speak in gratitude of what I know,
For all I have I owe to thee alone.
Give me thy hand, O Prince, that I may touch it,
And if thou wilt permit me, kiss thy cheek.
What say I?  Can I wish that thou should'st touch
One fallen like me to utter wretchedness,
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand ills?
Oh no, I would not let thee if thou would'st.
They only who have known calamity
Can share it.  Let me greet thee where thou art,
And still befriend me as thou hast till now.

THESEUS
I marvel not if thou hast dallied long
In converse with thy children and preferred
Their speech to mine; I feel no jealousy,
I would be famous more by deeds than words.
Of this, old friend, thou hast had proof; my oath
I have fulfilled and brought thee back the maids
Alive and nothing harmed for all those threats.
And how the fight was won, 'twere waste of words
To boast--thy daughters here will tell thee all.
But of a matter that has lately chanced
On my way hitherward, I fain would have
Thy counsel--slight 'twould seem, yet worthy thought.
A wise man heeds all matters great or small.

OEDIPUS
What is it, son of Aegeus?  Let me hear.
Of what thou askest I myself know naught.

THESEUS
'Tis said a man, no countryman of thine,
But of thy kin, hath taken sanctuary
Beside the altar of Poseidon, where
I was at sacrifice when called away.

OEDIPUS
What is his country? what the suitor's prayer?

THESEUS
I know but one thing; he implores, I am told,
A word with thee--he will not trouble thee.

OEDIPUS
What seeks he?  If a suppliant, something grave.

THESEUS
He only waits, they say, to speak with thee,
And then unharmed to go upon his way.

OEDIPUS
I marvel who is this petitioner.

THESEUS
Think if there be not any of thy kin
At Argos who might claim this boon of thee.

OEDIPUS
Dear friend, forbear, I pray.

THESEUS
                              What ails thee now?

OEDIPUS
Ask it not of me.

THESEUS
                    Ask not what? explain.

OEDIPUS
Thy words have told me who the suppliant is.

THESEUS
Who can he be that I should frown on him?

OEDIPUS
My son, O king, my hateful son, whose words
Of all men's most would jar upon my ears.

THESEUS
Thou sure mightest listen.  If his suit offend,
No need to grant it.  Why so loth to hear him?

OEDIPUS
That voice, O king, grates on a father's ears;
I have come to loathe it.  Force me not to yield.

THESEUS
But he hath found asylum.  O beware,
And fail not in due reverence to the god.

ANTIGONE
O heed me, father, though I am young in years.
Let the prince have his will and pay withal
What in his eyes is service to the god;
For our sake also let our brother come.
If what he urges tend not to thy good
He cannot surely wrest perforce thy will.
To hear him then, what harm?  By open words
A scheme of villainy is soon bewrayed.
Thou art his father, therefore canst not pay
In kind a son's most impious outrages.
O listen to him; other men like thee
Have thankless children and are choleric,
But yielding to persuasion's gentle spell
They let their savage mood be exorcised.
Look thou to the past, forget the present, think
On all the woe thy sire and mother brought thee;
Thence wilt thou draw this lesson without fail,
Of evil passion evil is the end.
Thou hast, alas, to prick thy memory,
Stern monitors, these ever-sightless orbs.
O yield to us; just suitors should not need
To be importunate, nor he that takes
A favor lack the grace to make return.

OEDIPUS
Grievous to me, my child, the boon ye win
By pleading.  Let it be then; have your way
Only if come he must, I beg thee, friend,
Let none have power to dispose of me.

THESEUS
No need, Sir, to appeal a second time.
It likes me not to boast, but be assured
Thy life is safe while any god saves mine.
[Exit THESEUS]

CHORUS
(Str.)
Who craves excess of days,
          Scorning the common span
          Of life, I judge that man
A giddy wight who walks in folly's ways.
For the long years heap up a grievous load,
          Scant pleasures, heavier pains,
          Till not one joy remains
For him who lingers on life's weary road
     And come it slow or fast,
          One doom of fate
          Doth all await,
          For dance and marriage bell,
          The dirge and funeral knell.
Death the deliverer freeth all at last.
(Ant.)
          Not to be born at all
          Is best, far best that can befall,
          Next best, when born, with least delay
          To trace the backward way.
For when youth passes with its giddy train,
     Troubles on troubles follow, toils on toils,
          Pain, pain for ever pain;
          And none escapes life's coils.
          Envy, sedition, strife,
Carnage and war, make up the tale of life.
Last comes the worst and most abhorred stage
          Of unregarded age,
Joyless, companionless and slow,
          Of woes the crowning woe.

(Epode)
Such ills not I alone,
He too our guest hath known,
E'en as some headland on an iron-bound shore,
Lashed by the wintry blasts and surge's roar,
So is he buffeted on every side
By drear misfortune's whelming tide,
          By every wind of heaven o'erborne
          Some from the sunset, some from orient morn,
          Some from the noonday glow.
Some from Rhipean gloom of everlasting snow.

ANTIGONE
Father, methinks I see the stranger coming,
Alone he comes and weeping plenteous tears.

OEDIPUS
Who may he be?

ANTIGONE
               The same that we surmised.
From the outset--Polyneices.  He is here.
[Enter POLYNEICES]

POLYNEICES
Ah me, my sisters, shall I first lament
My own afflictions, or my aged sire's,
Whom here I find a castaway, with you,
In a strange land, an ancient beggar clad
In antic tatters, marring all his frame,
While o'er the sightless orbs his unkept locks
Float in the breeze; and, as it were to match,
He bears a wallet against hunger's pinch.
All this too late I learn, wretch that I am,
Alas!  I own it, and am proved most vile
In my neglect of thee:  I scorn myself.
But as almighty Zeus in all he doth
Hath Mercy for co-partner of this throne,
Let Mercy, father, also sit enthroned
In thy heart likewise.  For transgressions past
May be amended, cannot be made worse.

Why silent?  Father, speak, nor turn away,
Hast thou no word, wilt thou dismiss me then
In mute disdain, nor tell me why thou art wrath?
O ye his daughters, sisters mine, do ye
This sullen, obstinate silence try to move.
Let him not spurn, without a single word
Of answer, me the suppliant of the god.

ANTIGONE
Tell him thyself, unhappy one, thine errand;
For large discourse may send a thrill of joy,
Or stir a chord of wrath or tenderness,
And to the tongue-tied somehow give a tongue.

POLYNEICES
Well dost thou counsel, and I will speak out.
First will I call in aid the god himself,
Poseidon, from whose altar I was raised,
With warrant from the monarch of this land,
To parley with you, and depart unscathed.
These pledges, strangers, I would see observed
By you and by my sisters and my sire.
Now, father, let me tell thee why I came.
I have been banished from my native land
Because by right of primogeniture
I claimed possession of thy sovereign throne
Wherefrom Etocles, my younger brother,
Ousted me, not by weight of precedent,
Nor by the last arbitrament of war,
But by his popular acts; and the prime cause
Of this I deem the curse that rests on thee.
So likewise hold the soothsayers, for when
I came to Argos in the Dorian land
And took the king Adrastus' child to wife,
Under my standard I enlisted all
The foremost captains of the Apian isle,
To levy with their aid that sevenfold host
Of spearmen against Thebes, determining
To oust my foes or die in a just cause.
Why then, thou askest, am I here today?
Father, I come a suppliant to thee
Both for myself and my allies who now
With squadrons seven beneath their seven spears
Beleaguer all the plain that circles Thebes.
Foremost the peerless warrior, peerless seer,
Amphiaraiis with his lightning lance;
Next an Aetolian, Tydeus, Oeneus' son;
Eteoclus of Argive birth the third;
The fourth Hippomedon, sent to the war
By his sire Talaos; Capaneus, the fifth,
Vaunts he will fire and raze the town; the sixth
Parthenopaeus, an Arcadian born
Named of that maid, longtime a maid and late
Espoused, Atalanta's true-born child;
Last I thy son, or thine at least in name,
If but the bastard of an evil fate,
Lead against Thebes the fearless Argive host.
Thus by thy children and thy life, my sire,
We all adjure thee to remit thy wrath
And favor one who seeks a just revenge
Against a brother who has banned and robbed him.
For victory, if oracles speak true,
Will fall to those who have thee for ally.
So, by our fountains and familiar gods
I pray thee, yield and hear; a beggar I
And exile, thou an exile likewise; both
Involved in one misfortune find a home
As pensioners, while he, the lord of Thebes,
O agony! makes a mock of thee and me.
I'll scatter with a breath the upstart's might,
And bring thee home again and stablish thee,
And stablish, having cast him out, myself.
This will thy goodwill I will undertake,
Without it I can scare return alive.

CHORUS
For the king's sake who sent him, Oedipus,
Dismiss him not without a meet reply.

OEDIPUS
Nay, worthy seniors, but for Theseus' sake
Who sent him hither to have word of me.
Never again would he have heard my voice;
But now he shall obtain this parting grace,
An answer that will bring him little joy.
O villain, when thou hadst the sovereignty
That now thy brother holdeth in thy stead,
Didst thou not drive me, thine own father, out,
An exile, cityless, and make we wear
This beggar's garb thou weepest to behold,
Now thou art come thyself to my sad plight?
Nothing is here for tears; it must be borne
By _me_ till death, and I shall think of thee
As of my murderer; thou didst thrust me out;
'Tis thou hast made me conversant with woe,
Through thee I beg my bread in a strange land;
And had not these my daughters tended me
I had been dead for aught of aid from thee.
They tend me, they preserve me, they are men
Not women in true service to their sire;
But ye are bastards, and no sons of mine.
Therefore just Heaven hath an eye on thee;
Howbeit not yet with aspect so austere
As thou shalt soon experience, if indeed
These banded hosts are moving against Thebes.
That city thou canst never storm, but first
Shall fall, thou and thy brother, blood-imbrued.
Such curse I lately launched against you twain,
Such curse I now invoke to fight for me,
That ye may learn to honor those who bear thee
Nor flout a sightless father who begat
Degenerate sons--these maidens did not so.
Therefore my curse is stronger than thy "throne,"
Thy "suppliance," if by right of laws eterne
Primeval Justice sits enthroned with Zeus.
Begone, abhorred, disowned, no son of mine,
Thou vilest of the vile! and take with thee
This curse I leave thee as my last bequest:--
Never to win by arms thy native land,
No, nor return to Argos in the Vale,
But by a kinsman's hand to die and slay
Him who expelled thee.  So I pray and call
On the ancestral gloom of Tartarus
To snatch thee hence, on these dread goddesses
I call, and Ares who incensed you both
To mortal enmity.  Go now proclaim
What thou hast heard to the Cadmeians all,
Thy staunch confederates--this the heritage
that Oedipus divideth to his sons.

CHORUS
Thy errand, Polyneices, liked me not
From the beginning; now go back with speed.

POLYNEICES
Woe worth my journey and my baffled hopes!
Woe worth my comrades!  What a desperate end
To that glad march from Argos!  Woe is me!
I dare not whisper it to my allies
Or turn them back, but mute must meet my doom.
My sisters, ye his daughters, ye have heard
The prayers of our stern father, if his curse
Should come to pass and ye some day return
To Thebes, O then disown me not, I pray,
But grant me burial and due funeral rites.
So shall the praise your filial care now wins
Be doubled for the service wrought for me.

ANTIGONE
One boon, O Polyneices, let me crave.

POLYNEICES
What would'st thou, sweet Antigone?  Say on.

ANTIGONE
Turn back thy host to Argos with all speed,
And ruin not thyself and Thebes as well.

POLYNEICES
That cannot be.  How could I lead again
An army that had seen their leader quail?

ANTIGONE
But, brother, why shouldst thou be wroth again?
What profit from thy country's ruin comes?

POLYNEICES
'Tis shame to live in exile, and shall I
The elder bear a younger brother's flouts?

ANTIGONE
Wilt thou then bring to pass his prophecies
Who threatens mutual slaughter to you both?

POLYNEICES
Aye, so he wishes:--but I must not yield.

ANTIGONE
O woe is me! but say, will any dare,
Hearing his prophecy, to follow thee?

POLYNEICES
I shall not tell it; a good general
Reports successes and conceals mishaps.

ANTIGONE
Misguided youth, thy purpose then stands fast!

POLYNEICES
'Tis so, and stay me not.  The road I choose,
Dogged by my sire and his avenging spirit,
Leads me to ruin; but for you may Zeus
Make your path bright if ye fulfill my hest
When dead; in life ye cannot serve me more.
Now let me go, farewell, a long farewell!
Ye ne'er shall see my living face again.

ANTIGONE
Ah me!

POLYNEICES
          Bewail me not.

ANTIGONE
                         Who would not mourn
Thee, brother, hurrying to an open pit!

POLYNEICES
If I must die, I must.

ANTIGONE
                         Nay, hear me plead.

POLYNEICES
It may not be; forbear.

ANTIGONE
                         Then woe is me,
If I must lose thee.

POLYNEICES
                    Nay, that rests with fate,
Whether I live or die; but for you both
I pray to heaven ye may escape all ill;
For ye are blameless in the eyes of all.
[Exit POLYNEICES]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
     Ills on ills! no pause or rest!
     Come they from our sightless guest?
     Or haply now we see fulfilled
     What fate long time hath willed?
     For ne'er have I proved vain
     Aught that the heavenly powers ordain.
     Time with never sleeping eye
     Watches what is writ on high,
     Overthrowing now the great,
     Raising now from low estate.
Hark!  How the thunder rumbles!  Zeus defend us!

OEDIPUS
Children, my children! will no messenger
Go summon hither Theseus my best friend?

ANTIGONE
And wherefore, father, dost thou summon him?

OEDIPUS
This winged thunder of the god must bear me
Anon to Hades.  Send and tarry not.

CHORUS
(Ant. 1)
Hark! with louder, nearer roar
The bolt of Zeus descends once more.
My spirit quails and cowers:  my hair
Bristles for fear.  Again that flare!
What doth the lightning-flash portend?
Ever it points to issues grave.
Dread powers of air!  Save, Zeus, O save!

OEDIPUS
Daughters, upon me the predestined end
Has come; no turning from it any more.

ANTIGONE
How knowest thou?  What sign convinces thee?

OEDIPUS
I know full well.  Let some one with all speed
Go summon hither the Athenian prince.

CHORUS
(Str. 2)
Ha! once more the deafening sound
Peals yet louder all around
If thou darkenest our land,
Lightly, lightly lay thy hand;
Grace, not anger, let me win,
If upon a man of sin
I have looked with pitying eye,
Zeus, our king, to thee I cry!

OEDIPUS
Is the prince coming?  Will he when he comes
Find me yet living and my senses clear!

ANTIGONE
What solemn charge would'st thou impress on him?

OEDIPUS
For all his benefits I would perform
The promise made when I received them first.

CHORUS
(Ant. 2)
          Hither haste, my son, arise,
          Altar leave and sacrifice,
          If haply to Poseidon now
          In the far glade thou pay'st thy vow.
          For our guest to thee would bring
          And thy folk and offering,
          Thy due guerdon.  Haste, O King!
[Enter THESEUS]

THESEUS
Wherefore again this general din? at once
My people call me and the stranger calls.
Is it a thunderbolt of Zeus or sleet
Of arrowy hail? a storm so fierce as this
Would warrant all surmises of mischance.

OEDIPUS
Thou com'st much wished for, Prince, and sure some god
Hath bid good luck attend thee on thy way.

THESEUS
What, son of Laius, hath chanced of new?

OEDIPUS
My life hath turned the scale.  I would do all
I promised thee and thine before I die.

THESEUS
What sign assures thee that thine end is near?

OEDIPUS
The gods themselves are heralds of my fate;
Of their appointed warnings nothing fails.

THESEUS
How sayest thou they signify their will?

OEDIPUS
This thunder, peal on peal, this lightning hurled
Flash upon flash, from the unconquered hand.

THESEUS
I must believe thee, having found thee oft
A prophet true; then speak what must be done.

OEDIPUS
O son of Aegeus, for this state will I
Unfold a treasure age cannot corrupt.
Myself anon without a guiding hand
Will take thee to the spot where I must end.
This secret ne'er reveal to mortal man,
Neither the spot nor whereabouts it lies,
So shall it ever serve thee for defense
Better than native shields and near allies.
But those dread mysteries speech may not profane
Thyself shalt gather coming there alone;
Since not to any of thy subjects,  nor
To my own children, though I love them dearly,
Can I reveal what thou must guard alone,
And whisper to thy chosen heir alone,
So to be handed down from heir to heir.
Thus shalt thou hold this land inviolate
From the dread Dragon's brood. [7]  The justest State
By countless wanton neighbors may be wronged,
For the gods, though they tarry, mark for doom
The godless sinner in his mad career.
Far from thee, son of Aegeus, be such fate!
But to the spot--the god within me goads--
Let us set forth no longer hesitate.
Follow me, daughters, this way.  Strange that I
Whom you have led so long should lead you now.
Oh, touch me not, but let me all alone
Find out the sepulcher that destiny
Appoints me in this land.  Hither, this way,
For this way Hermes leads, the spirit guide,
And Persephassa, empress of the dead.
O light, no light to me, but mine erewhile,
Now the last time I feel thee palpable,
For I am drawing near the final gloom
Of Hades.  Blessing on thee, dearest friend,
On thee and on thy land and followers!
Live prosperous and in your happy state
Still for your welfare think on me, the dead.
[Exit THESEUS followed by ANTIGONE and ISMENE]

CHORUS
(Str.)
          If mortal prayers are heard in hell,
          Hear, Goddess dread, invisible!
          Monarch of the regions drear,
               Aidoneus, hear, O hear!
          By a gentle, tearless doom
          Speed this stranger to the gloom,
          Let him enter without pain
          The all-shrouding Stygian plain.
          Wrongfully in life oppressed,
          Be he now by Justice blessed.

(Ant.)
          Queen infernal, and thou fell
          Watch-dog of the gates of hell,
          Who, as legends tell, dost glare,
          Gnarling in thy cavernous lair
          At all comers, let him go
          Scathless to the fields below.
          For thy master orders thus,
          The son of earth and Tartarus;
          In his den the monster keep,
          Giver of eternal sleep.
[Enter MESSENGER]

MESSENGER
Friends, countrymen, my tidings are in sum
That Oedipus is gone, but the event
Was not so brief, nor can the tale be brief.

CHORUS
What, has he gone, the unhappy man?

MESSENGER
                                   Know well
That he has passed away from life to death.

CHORUS
How?  By a god-sent, painless doom, poor soul?

MESSENGER
Thy question hits the marvel of the tale.
How he moved hence, you saw him and must know;
Without a friend to lead the way, himself
Guiding us all.  So having reached the abrupt
Earth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,
He paused at one of the converging paths,
Hard by the rocky basin which records
The pact of Theseus and Peirithous.
Betwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,
The hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,
Midway he sat and loosed his beggar's weeds;
Then calling to his daughters bade them fetch
Of running water, both to wash withal
And make libation; so they clomb the steep;
And in brief space brought what their father bade,
Then laved and dressed him with observance due.
But when he had his will in everything,
And no desire was left unsatisfied,
It thundered from the netherworld; the maids
Shivered, and crouching at their father's knees
Wept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.
He, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,
Folded his arms about them both and said,
"My children, ye will lose your sire today,
For all of me has perished, and no more
Have ye to bear your long, long ministry;
A heavy load, I know, and yet one word
Wipes out all score of tribulations--_love_.
And love from me ye had--from no man more;
But now must live without me all your days."
So clinging to each other sobbed and wept
Father and daughters both, but when at last
Their mourning had an end and no wail rose,
A moment there was silence; suddenly
A voice that summoned him; with sudden dread
The hair of all stood up and all were 'mazed;
For the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.
"Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?
Too long, too long thy passing is delayed."
But when he heard the summons of the god,
He prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when
The Prince came nearer:  "O my friend," he cried,
"Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand--
And, daughters, give him yours--and promise me
Thou never wilt forsake them, but do all
That time and friendship prompt in their behoof."
And he of his nobility repressed
His tears and swore to be their constant friend.
This promise given, Oedipus put forth
Blind hands and laid them on his children, saying,
"O children, prove your true nobility
And hence depart nor seek to witness sights
Unlawful or to hear unlawful words.
Nay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,
Our ruler, to behold what next shall hap."
So we all heard him speak, and weeping sore
We companied the maidens on their way.
After brief space we looked again, and lo
The man was gone, evanished from our eyes;
Only the king we saw with upraised hand
Shading his eyes as from some awful sight,
That no man might endure to look upon.
A moment later, and we saw him bend
In prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.
But by what doom the stranger met his end
No man save Theseus knoweth.  For there fell
No fiery bold that reft him in that hour,
Nor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.
It was a messenger from heaven, or else
Some gentle, painless cleaving of earth's base;
For without wailing or disease or pain
He passed away--and end most marvelous.
And if to some my tale seems foolishness
I am content that such could count me fool.

CHORUS
Where are the maids and their attendant friends?

MESSENGER
They cannot be far off; the approaching sound
Of lamentation tells they come this way.
[Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE]

ANTIGONE
(Str. 1)
Woe, woe! on this sad day
     We sisters of one blasted stock
     must bow beneath the shock,
Must weep and weep the curse that lay
     On him our sire, for whom
In life, a life-long world of care
     'Twas ours to bear,
     In death must face the gloom
     That wraps his tomb.
What tongue can tell
That sight ineffable?

CHORUS
What mean ye, maidens?

ANTIGONE
                         All is but surmise.

CHORUS
Is he then gone?

ANTIGONE
                    Gone as ye most might wish.
Not in battle or sea storm,
But reft from sight,
By hands invisible borne
To viewless fields of night.
Ah me! on us too night has come,
The night of mourning.  Wither roam
O'er land or sea in our distress
Eating the bread of bitterness?

ISMENE
I know not.  O that Death
Might nip my breath,
And let me share my aged father's fate.
I cannot live a life thus desolate.

CHORUS
Best of daughters, worthy pair,
What heaven brings ye needs must bear,
Fret no more 'gainst Heaven's will;
Fate hath dealt with you not ill.

ANTIGONE
(Ant. 1)
Love can turn past pain to bliss,
     What seemed bitter now is sweet.
Ah me! that happy toil is sweet.
     The guidance of those dear blind feet.
Dear father, wrapt for aye in nether gloom,
     E'en in the tomb
Never shalt thou lack of love repine,
     Her love and mine.

CHORUS
His fate--

ANTIGONE
          Is even as he planned.

CHORUS
How so?

ANTIGONE
He died, so willed he, in a foreign land.
Lapped in kind earth he sleeps his long last sleep,
     And o'er his grave friends weep.
How great our lost these streaming eyes can tell,
     This sorrow naught can quell.
Thou hadst thy wish 'mid strangers thus to die,
     But I, ah me, not by.

ISMENE
Alas, my sister, what new fate
*     *     *     *     *     *
*     *     *     *     *     *
Befalls us orphans desolate?

CHORUS
His end was blessed; therefore, children, stay
Your sorrow.  Man is born to fate a prey.

ANTIGONE
(Str. 2)
Sister, let us back again.

ISMENE
Why return?

ANTIGONE
               My soul is fain--
ISMENE
Is fain?

ANTIGONE
          To see the earthy bed.

ISMENE
Sayest thou?

ANTIGONE
               Where our sire is laid.

ISMENE
Nay, thou can'st not, dost not see--

ANTIGONE
Sister, wherefore wroth with me?

ISMENE
Know'st not--beside--

ANTIGONE
                    More must I hear?

ISMENE
Tombless he died, none near.

ANTIGONE
Lead me thither; slay me there.

ISMENE
How shall I unhappy fare,
Friendless, helpless, how drag on
A life of misery alone?

CHORUS
(Ant. 2)
Fear not, maids--

ANTIGONE
                    Ah, whither flee?

CHORUS
Refuge hath been found.

ANTIGONE
                         For me?

CHORUS
Where thou shalt be safe from harm.

ANTIGONE
I know it.

CHORUS
          Why then this alarm?

ANTIGONE
How again to get us home
I know not.

CHORUS
               Why then this roam?

ANTIGONE
Troubles whelm us--

CHORUS
                    As of yore.

ANTIGONE
Worse than what was worse before.

CHORUS
Sure ye are driven on the breakers' surge.

ANTIGONE
Alas! we are.

CHORUS
               Alas! 'tis so.

ANTIGONE
Ah whither turn, O Zeus?  No ray
Of hope to cheer the way
Whereon the fates our desperate voyage urge.
[Enter THESEUS]

THESEUS
Dry your tears; when grace is shed
On the quick and on the dead
By dark Powers beneficent,
Over-grief they would resent.

ANTIGONE
Aegeus' child, to thee we pray.

THESEUS
What the boon, my children, say.

ANTIGONE
With our own eyes we fain would see
Our father's tomb.

THESEUS
                    That may not be.

ANTIGONE
What say'st thou, King?

THESEUS
                         My children, he
Charged me straitly that no moral
Should approach the sacred portal,
Or greet with funeral litanies
The hidden tomb wherein he lies;
Saying, "If thou keep'st my hest
Thou shalt hold thy realm at rest."
The God of Oaths this promise heard,
And to Zeus I pledged my word.

ANTIGONE
Well, if he would have it so,
We must yield.  Then let us go
Back to Thebes, if yet we may
Heal this mortal feud and stay
The self-wrought doom
That drives our brothers to their tomb.

THESEUS
Go in peace; nor will I spare
Ought of toil and zealous care,
But on all your needs attend,
Gladdening in his grave my friend.

CHORUS
Wail no more, let sorrow rest,
All is ordered for the best.

                               ARGUMENT

Antigone, daughter of Oedipus, the late king of Thebes, in defiance of
Creon who rules in his stead, resolves to bury her brother Polyneices,
slain in his attack on Thebes. She is caught in the act by Creon's
watchmen and brought before the king. She justifies her action,
asserting that she was bound to obey the eternal laws of right and wrong
in spite of any human ordinance. Creon, unrelenting, condemns her to be
immured in a rock-hewn chamber. His son Haemon, to whom Antigone is
betrothed, pleads in vain for her life and threatens to die with her.
Warned by the seer Teiresias Creon repents him and hurries to release
Antigone from her rocky prison. But he is too late: he finds lying side
by side Antigone who had hanged herself and Haemon who also has perished
by his own hand. Returning to the palace he sees within the dead body of
his queen who on learning of her son's death has stabbed herself to the
heart.

                               ANTIGONE


             ANTIGONE and ISMENE before the Palace gates.

ANTIGONE
Ismene, sister of my blood and heart,
See'st thou how Zeus would in our lives fulfill
The weird of Oedipus, a world of woes!
For what of pain, affliction, outrage, shame,
Is lacking in our fortunes, thine and mine?
And now this proclamation of today
Made by our Captain-General to the State,
What can its purport be?  Didst hear and heed,
Or art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?

ISMENE
To me, Antigone, no word of friends
Has come, or glad or grievous, since we twain
Were reft of our two brethren in one day
By double fratricide; and since i' the night
Our Argive leaguers fled, no later news
Has reached me, to inspirit or deject.

ANTIGONE
I know 'twas so, and therefore summoned thee
Beyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.

ISMENE
What is it?  Some dark secret stirs thy breast.

ANTIGONE
What but the thought of our two brothers dead,
The one by Creon graced with funeral rites,
The other disappointed?  Eteocles
He hath consigned to earth (as fame reports)
With obsequies that use and wont ordain,
So gracing him among the dead below.
But Polyneices, a dishonored corse,
(So by report the royal edict runs)
No man may bury him or make lament--
Must leave him tombless and unwept, a feast
For kites to scent afar and swoop upon.
Such is the edict (if report speak true)
Of Creon, our most noble Creon, aimed
At thee and me, aye me too; and anon
He will be here to promulgate, for such
As have not heard, his mandate; 'tis in sooth
No passing humor, for the edict says
Whoe'er transgresses shall be stoned to death.
So stands it with us; now 'tis thine to show
If thou art worthy of thy blood or base.

ISMENE
But how, my rash, fond sister, in such case
Can I do anything to make or mar?

ANTIGONE
Say, wilt thou aid me and abet?  Decide.

ISMENE
In what bold venture?  What is in thy thought?

ANTIGONE
Lend me a hand to bear the corpse away.

ISMENE
What, bury him despite the interdict?

ANTIGONE
My brother, and, though thou deny him, thine
No man shall say that _I_ betrayed a brother.

ISMENE
Wilt thou persist, though Creon has forbid?

ANTIGONE
What right has he to keep me from my own?

ISMENE
Bethink thee, sister, of our father's fate,
Abhorred, dishonored, self-convinced of sin,
Blinded, himself his executioner.
Think of his mother-wife (ill sorted names)
Done by a noose herself had twined to death
And last, our hapless brethren in one day,
Both in a mutual destiny involved,
Self-slaughtered, both the slayer and the slain.
Bethink thee, sister, we are left alone;
Shall we not perish wretchedest of all,
If in defiance of the law we cross
A monarch's will?--weak women, think of that,
Not framed by nature to contend with men.
Remember this too that the stronger rules;
We must obey his orders, these or worse.
Therefore I plead compulsion and entreat
The dead to pardon.  I perforce obey
The powers that be.  'Tis foolishness, I ween,
To overstep in aught the golden mean.

ANTIGONE
I urge no more; nay, wert thou willing still,
I would not welcome such a fellowship.
Go thine own way; myself will bury him.
How sweet to die in such employ, to rest,--
Sister and brother linked in love's embrace--
A sinless sinner, banned awhile on earth,
But by the dead commended; and with them
I shall abide for ever.  As for thee,
Scorn, if thou wilt, the eternal laws of Heaven.

ISMENE
I scorn them not, but to defy the State
Or break her ordinance I have no skill.

ANTIGONE
A specious pretext.  I will go alone
To lap my dearest brother in the grave.

ISMENE
My poor, fond sister, how I fear for thee!

ANTIGONE
O waste no fears on me; look to thyself.

ISMENE
At least let no man know of thine intent,
But keep it close and secret, as will I.

ANTIGONE
O tell it, sister; I shall hate thee more
If thou proclaim it not to all the town.

ISMENE
Thou hast a fiery soul for numbing work.

ANTIGONE
I pleasure those whom I would liefest please.

ISMENE
If thou succeed; but thou art doomed to fail.

ANTIGONE
When strength shall fail me, yes, but not before.

ISMENE
But, if the venture's hopeless, why essay?

ANTIGONE
Sister, forbear, or I shall hate thee soon,
And the dead man will hate thee too, with cause.
Say I am mad and give my madness rein
To wreck itself; the worst that can befall
Is but to die an honorable death.

ISMENE
Have thine own way then; 'tis a mad endeavor,
Yet to thy lovers thou art dear as ever.
[Exeunt]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Sunbeam, of all that ever dawn upon
          Our seven-gated Thebes the brightest ray,
               O eye of golden day,
How fair thy light o'er Dirce's fountain shone,
Speeding upon their headlong homeward course,
Far quicker than they came, the Argive force;
               Putting to flight
The argent shields, the host with scutcheons white.
Against our land the proud invader came
To vindicate fell Polyneices' claim.
          Like to an eagle swooping low,
          On pinions white as new fall'n snow.
With clanging scream, a horsetail plume his crest,
The aspiring lord of Argos onward pressed.

(Ant. 1)
Hovering around our city walls he waits,
His spearmen raven at our seven gates.
But ere a torch our crown of towers could burn,
Ere they had tasted of our blood, they turn
Forced by the Dragon; in their rear
The din of Ares panic-struck they hear.
For Zeus who hates the braggart's boast
Beheld that gold-bespangled host;
As at the goal the paean they upraise,
He struck them with his forked lightning blaze.

(Str. 2)
To earthy from earth rebounding, down he crashed;
     The fire-brand from his impious hand was dashed,
As like a Bacchic reveler on he came,
Outbreathing hate and flame,
And tottered.  Elsewhere in the field,
Here, there, great Area like a war-horse wheeled;
          Beneath his car down thrust
          Our foemen bit the dust.

Seven captains at our seven gates
Thundered; for each a champion waits,
Each left behind his armor bright,
Trophy for Zeus who turns the fight;
Save two alone, that ill-starred pair
One mother to one father bare,
Who lance in rest, one 'gainst the other
Drave, and both perished, brother slain by brother.

(Ant. 2)
Now Victory to Thebes returns again
And smiles upon her chariot-circled plain.
          Now let feast and festal should
          Memories of war blot out.
          Let us to the temples throng,
          Dance and sing the live night long.
          God of Thebes, lead thou the round.
          Bacchus, shaker of the ground!
          Let us end our revels here;
          Lo! Creon our new lord draws near,
          Crowned by this strange chance, our king.
          What, I marvel, pondering?
          Why this summons?  Wherefore call
          Us, his elders, one and all,
          Bidding us with him debate,
          On some grave concern of State?
[Enter CREON]

CREON
Elders, the gods have righted one again
Our storm-tossed ship of state, now safe in port.
But you by special summons I convened
As my most trusted councilors; first, because
I knew you loyal to Laius of old;
Again, when Oedipus restored our State,
Both while he ruled and when his rule was o'er,
Ye still were constant to the royal line.
Now that his two sons perished in one day,
Brother by brother murderously slain,
By right of kinship to the Princes dead,
I claim and hold the throne and sovereignty.
Yet 'tis no easy matter to discern
The temper of a man, his mind and will,
Till he be proved by exercise of power;
And in my case, if one who reigns supreme
Swerve from the highest policy, tongue-tied
By fear of consequence, that man I hold,
And ever held, the basest of the base.
And I contemn the man who sets his friend
Before his country.  For myself, I call
To witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,
If I perceive some mischievous design
To sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;
Nor would I reckon as my private friend
A public foe, well knowing that the State
Is the good ship that holds our fortunes all:
Farewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.
Such is the policy by which I seek
To serve the Commons and conformably
I have proclaimed an edict as concerns
The sons of Oedipus; Eteocles
Who in his country's battle fought and fell,
The foremost champion--duly bury him
With all observances and ceremonies
That are the guerdon of the heroic dead.
But for the miscreant exile who returned
Minded in flames and ashes to blot out
His father's city and his father's gods,
And glut his vengeance with his kinsmen's blood,
Or drag them captive at his chariot wheels--
For Polyneices 'tis ordained that none
Shall give him burial or make mourn for him,
But leave his corpse unburied, to be meat
For dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.
So am I purposed; never by my will
Shall miscreants take precedence of true men,
But all good patriots, alive or dead,
Shall be by me preferred and honored.

CHORUS
Son of Menoeceus, thus thou will'st to deal
With him who loathed and him who loved our State.
Thy word is law; thou canst dispose of us
The living, as thou will'st, as of the dead.

CREON
See then ye execute what I ordain.

CHORUS
On younger shoulders lay this grievous charge.

CREON
Fear not, I've posted guards to watch the corpse.

CHORUS
What further duty would'st thou lay on us?

CREON
Not to connive at disobedience.

CHORUS
No man is mad enough to court his death.

CREON
The penalty _is_ death:  yet hope of gain
Hath lured men to their ruin oftentimes.
[Enter GUARD]

GUARD
My lord, I will not make pretense to pant
And puff as some light-footed messenger.
In sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought
Made many a halt and turned and turned again;
For conscience plied her spur and curb by turns.
"Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?"
She whispered.  Then again, "If Creon learn
This from another, thou wilt rue it worse."
Thus leisurely I hastened on my road;
Much thought extends a furlong to a league.
But in the end the forward voice prevailed,
To face thee.  I will speak though I say nothing.
For plucking courage from despair methought,
'Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.'

CREON
What is thy news?  Why this despondency?

GUARD
Let me premise a word about myself?
I neither did the deed nor saw it done,
Nor were it just that I should come to harm.

CREON
Thou art good at parry, and canst fence about
Some matter of grave import, as is plain.

GUARD
The bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.

CREON
Then, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.

GUARD
Well, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone
E'en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,
Performed the proper ritual--and was gone.

CREON
What say'st thou?  Who hath dared to do this thing?

GUARD
I cannot tell, for there was ne'er a trace
Of pick or mattock--hard unbroken ground,
Without a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,
No sign that human hands had been at work.
When the first sentry of the morning watch
Gave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.
The corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,
But strewn with dust, as if by one who sought
To avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:
Of hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.
Thereat arose an angry war of words;
Guard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,
For none was there to part us, each in turn
Suspected, but the guilt brought home to none,
From lack of evidence.  We challenged each
The ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,
Or pass through fire, affirming on our oath
Our innocence--we neither did the deed
Ourselves, nor know who did or compassed it.
Our quest was at a standstill, when one spake
And bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,
For there was no gainsaying him nor way
To escape perdition:  _Ye_are_bound_to_tell_
_The_King,_ye_cannot_hide_it; so he spake.
And he convinced us all; so lots were cast,
And I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.
So here I am unwilling and withal
Unwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.

CHORUS
I had misgivings from the first, my liege,
Of something more than natural at work.

CREON
O cease, you vex me with your babblement;
I am like to think you dote in your old age.
Is it not arrant folly to pretend
That gods would have a thought for this dead man?
Did they forsooth award him special grace,
And as some benefactor bury him,
Who came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,
To sack their shrines, to desolate their land,
And scout their ordinances?  Or perchance
The gods bestow their favors on the bad.
No! no! I have long noted malcontents
Who wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,
Misliking these my orders, and my rule.
'Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards
By bribes.  Of evils current upon earth
The worst is money.  Money 'tis that sacks
Cities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;
Warps and seduces native innocence,
And breeds a habit of dishonesty.
But they who sold themselves shall find their greed
Out-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.
Yea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,
By Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring
Before my presence here the very man
Who carried out this lawless burial,
Death for your punishment shall not suffice.
Hanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make
Confession of this outrage.  This will teach you
What practices are like to serve your turn.
There are some villainies that bring no gain.
For by dishonesty the few may thrive,
The many come to ruin and disgrace.

GUARD
May I not speak, or must I turn and go
Without a word?--

CREON
                    Begone! canst thou not see
That e'en this question irks me?

GUARD
                                   Where, my lord?
Is it thy ears that suffer, or thy heart?

CREON
Why seek to probe and find the seat of pain?

GUARD
I gall thine ears--this miscreant thy mind.

CREON
What an inveterate babbler! get thee gone!

GUARD
Babbler perchance, but innocent of the crime.

CREON
Twice guilty, having sold thy soul for gain.

GUARD
Alas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.

CREON
Go, quibble with thy reason.  If thou fail'st
To find these malefactors, thou shalt own
The wages of ill-gotten gains is death.
[Exit CREON]

GUARD
I pray he may be found.  But caught or not
(And fortune must determine that) thou never
Shalt see me here returning; that is sure.
For past all hope or thought I have escaped,
And for my safety owe the gods much thanks.

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Many wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;
Over the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,
Through the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;
And the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay
Ever he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,
With breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.

(Ant. 1)
The light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood
He traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.
Master of cunning he:  the savage bull, and the hart
Who roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;
And the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.

(Str. 2)
Speech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,
He hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly
And the nipping airs that freeze, 'neath the open winter sky.
He hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;
Safe whate'er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.

(Ant. 2)
Passing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,
That guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.
If he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State
Proudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate
Whoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;
Ne'er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.

          What strange vision meets my eyes,
          Fills me with a wild surprise?
          Sure I know her, sure 'tis she,
          The maid Antigone.
          Hapless child of hapless sire,
          Didst thou recklessly conspire,
          Madly brave the King's decree?
          Therefore are they haling thee?
[Enter GUARD bringing ANTIGONE]

GUARD
Here is the culprit taken in the act
Of giving burial.  But where's the King?

CHORUS
There from the palace he returns in time.
[Enter CREON]

CREON
Why is my presence timely?  What has chanced?

GUARD
No man, my lord, should make a vow, for if
He ever swears he will not do a thing,
His afterthoughts belie his first resolve.
When from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled
I sware thou wouldst not see me here again;
But the wild rapture of a glad surprise
Intoxicates, and so I'm here forsworn.
And here's my prisoner, caught in the very act,
Decking the grave.  No lottery this time;
This prize is mine by right of treasure-trove.
So take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.
She's thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim
Hence to depart well quit of all these ills.

CREON
Say, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?

GUARD
Burying the man.  There's nothing more to tell.

CREON
Hast thou thy wits?  Or know'st thou what thou say'st?

GUARD
I saw this woman burying the corpse
Against thy orders.  Is that clear and plain?

CREON
But how was she surprised and caught in the act?

GUARD
It happened thus.  No sooner had we come,
Driven from thy presence by those awful threats,
Than straight we swept away all trace of dust,
And bared the clammy body.  Then we sat
High on the ridge to windward of the stench,
While each man kept he fellow alert and rated
Roundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.
So all night long we watched, until the sun
Stood high in heaven, and his blazing beams
Smote us.  A sudden whirlwind then upraised
A cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,
And swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,
And shook the firmament.  We closed our eyes
And waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.
At last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.
A piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,
As when the mother bird beholds her nest
Robbed of its nestlings; even so the maid
Wailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,
And cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.
Anon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,
Then, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,
Thrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.
We at the sight swooped down on her and seized
Our quarry.  Undismayed she stood, and when
We taxed her with the former crime and this,
She disowned nothing.  I was glad--and grieved;
For 'tis most sweet to 'scape oneself scot-free,
And yet to bring disaster to a friend
Is grievous.  Take it all in all, I deem
A man's first duty is to serve himself.

CREON
Speak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,
Does thou plead guilty or deny the deed?

ANTIGONE
Guilty.  I did it, I deny it not.

CREON (to GUARD)
Sirrah, begone whither thou wilt, and thank
Thy luck that thou hast 'scaped a heavy charge.
(To ANTIGONE)
Now answer this plain question, yes or no,
Wast thou acquainted with the interdict?

ANTIGONE
I knew, all knew; how should I fail to know?

CREON
And yet wert bold enough to break the law?

ANTIGONE
Yea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus,
And she who sits enthroned with gods below,
Justice, enacted not these human laws.
Nor did I deem that thou, a mortal man,
Could'st by a breath annul and override
The immutable unwritten laws of Heaven.
They were not born today nor yesterday;
They die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang.
I was not like, who feared no mortal's frown,
To disobey these laws and so provoke
The wrath of Heaven.  I knew that I must die,
E'en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death
Is thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.
For death is gain to him whose life, like mine,
Is full of misery.  Thus my lot appears
Not sad, but blissful; for had I endured
To leave my mother's son unburied there,
I should have grieved with reason, but not now.
And if in this thou judgest me a fool,
Methinks the judge of folly's not acquit.

CHORUS
A stubborn daughter of a stubborn sire,
This ill-starred maiden kicks against the pricks.

CREON
Well, let her know the stubbornest of wills
Are soonest bended, as the hardest iron,
O'er-heated in the fire to brittleness,
Flies soonest into fragments, shivered through.
A snaffle curbs the fieriest steed, and he
Who in subjection lives must needs be meek.
But this proud girl, in insolence well-schooled,
First overstepped the established law, and then--
A second and worse act of insolence--
She boasts and glories in her wickedness.
Now if she thus can flout authority
Unpunished, I am woman, she the man.
But though she be my sister's child or nearer
Of kin than all who worship at my hearth,
Nor she nor yet her sister shall escape
The utmost penalty, for both I hold,
As arch-conspirators, of equal guilt.
Bring forth the older; even now I saw her
Within the palace, frenzied and distraught.
The workings of the mind discover oft
Dark deeds in darkness schemed, before the act.
More hateful still the miscreant who seeks
When caught, to make a virtue of a crime.

ANTIGONE
Would'st thou do more than slay thy prisoner?

CREON
Not I, thy life is mine, and that's enough.

ANTIGONE
Why dally then?  To me no word of thine
Is pleasant:  God forbid it e'er should please;
Nor am I more acceptable to thee.
And yet how otherwise had I achieved
A name so glorious as by burying
A brother? so my townsmen all would say,
Where they not gagged by terror,  Manifold
A king's prerogatives, and not the least
That all his acts and all his words are law.

CREON
Of all these Thebans none so deems but thou.

ANTIGONE
These think as I, but bate their breath to thee.

CREON
Hast thou no shame to differ from all these?

ANTIGONE
To reverence kith and kin can bring no shame.

CREON
Was his dead foeman not thy kinsman too?

ANTIGONE
One mother bare them and the self-same sire.

CREON
Why cast a slur on one by honoring one?

ANTIGONE
The dead man will not bear thee out in this.

CREON
Surely, if good and evil fare alive.

ANTIGONE
The slain man was no villain but a brother.

CREON
The patriot perished by the outlaw's brand.

ANTIGONE
Nathless the realms below these rites require.

CREON
Not that the base should fare as do the brave.

ANTIGONE
Who knows if this world's crimes are virtues there?

CREON
Not even death can make a foe a friend.

ANTIGONE
My nature is for mutual love, not hate.

CREON
Die then, and love the dead if thou must;
No woman shall be the master while I live.
[Enter ISMENE]

CHORUS
          Lo from out the palace gate,
          Weeping o'er her sister's fate,
          Comes Ismene; see her brow,
          Once serene, beclouded now,
          See her beauteous face o'erspread
          With a flush of angry red.

CREON
Woman, who like a viper unperceived
Didst harbor in my house and drain my blood,
Two plagues I nurtured blindly, so it proved,
To sap my throne.  Say, didst thou too abet
This crime, or dost abjure all privity?

ISMENE
I did the deed, if she will have it so,
And with my sister claim to share the guilt.

ANTIGONE
That were unjust.  Thou would'st not act with me
At first, and I refused thy partnership.

ISMENE
But now thy bark is stranded, I am bold
To claim my share as partner in the loss.

ANTIGONE
Who did the deed the under-world knows well:
A friend in word is never friend of mine.

ISMENE
O sister, scorn me not, let me but share
Thy work of piety, and with thee die.

ANTIGONE
Claim not a work in which thou hadst no hand;
One death sufficeth.  Wherefore should'st thou die?

ISMENE
What would life profit me bereft of thee?

ANTIGONE
Ask Creon, he's thy kinsman and best friend.

ISMENE
Why taunt me?  Find'st thou pleasure in these gibes?

ANTIGONE
'Tis a sad mockery, if indeed I mock.

ISMENE
O say if I can help thee even now.

ANTIGONE
No, save thyself; I grudge not thy escape.

ISMENE
Is e'en this boon denied, to share thy lot?

ANTIGONE
Yea, for thou chosed'st life, and I to die.

ISMENE
Thou canst not say that I did not protest.

ANTIGONE
Well, some approved thy wisdom, others mine.

ISMENE
But now we stand convicted, both alike.

ANTIGONE
Fear not; thou livest, I died long ago
Then when I gave my life to save the dead.

CREON
Both maids, methinks, are crazed.  One suddenly
Has lost her wits, the other was born mad.

ISMENE
Yea, so it falls, sire, when misfortune comes,
The wisest even lose their mother wit.

CREON
I' faith thy wit forsook thee when thou mad'st
Thy choice with evil-doers to do ill.

ISMENE
What life for me without my sister here?

CREON
Say not thy sister _here_:  thy sister's dead.

ISMENE
What, wilt thou slay thy own son's plighted bride?

CREON
Aye, let him raise him seed from other fields.

ISMENE
No new espousal can be like the old.

CREON
A plague on trulls who court and woo our sons.

ANTIGONE
O Haemon, how thy sire dishonors thee!

CREON
A plague on thee and thy accursed bride!

CHORUS
What, wilt thou rob thine own son of his bride?

CREON
'Tis death that bars this marriage, not his sire.

CHORUS
So her death-warrant, it would seem, is sealed.

CREON
By you, as first by me; off with them, guards,
And keep them close.  Henceforward let them learn
To live as women use, not roam at large.
For e'en the bravest spirits run away
When they perceive death pressing on life's heels.

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Thrice blest are they who never tasted pain!
     If once the curse of Heaven attaint a race,
     The infection lingers on and speeds apace,
Age after age, and each the cup must drain.

So when Etesian blasts from Thrace downpour
     Sweep o'er the blackening main and whirl to land
     From Ocean's cavernous depths his ooze and sand,
Billow on billow thunders on the shore.

(Ant. 1)
On the Labdacidae I see descending
     Woe upon woe; from days of old some god
     Laid on the race a malison, and his rod
Scourges each age with sorrows never ending.

The light that dawned upon its last born son
     Is vanished, and the bloody axe of Fate
     Has felled the goodly tree that blossomed late.
O Oedipus, by reckless pride undone!

(Str. 2)
Thy might, O Zeus, what mortal power can quell?
Not sleep that lays all else beneath its spell,
Nor moons that never tire:  untouched by Time,
          Throned in the dazzling light
          That crowns Olympus' height,
Thou reignest King, omnipotent, sublime.

          Past, present, and to be,
          All bow to thy decree,
          All that exceeds the mean by Fate
          Is punished, Love or Hate.

(Ant. 2)
Hope flits about never-wearying wings;
Profit to some, to some light loves she brings,
But no man knoweth how her gifts may turn,
Till 'neath his feet the treacherous ashes burn.
Sure 'twas a sage inspired that spake this word;
          _If evil good appear_
          _To any, Fate is near_;
And brief the respite from her flaming sword.

          Hither comes in angry mood
          Haemon, latest of thy brood;
          Is it for his bride he's grieved,
          Or her marriage-bed deceived,
          Doth he make his mourn for thee,
          Maid forlorn, Antigone?
[Enter HAEMON]

CREON
Soon shall we know, better than seer can tell.
Learning may fixed decree anent thy bride,
Thou mean'st not, son, to rave against thy sire?
Know'st not whate'er we do is done in love?

HAEMON
O father, I am thine, and I will take
Thy wisdom as the helm to steer withal.
Therefore no wedlock shall by me be held
More precious than thy loving goverance.

CREON
Well spoken:  so right-minded sons should feel,
In all deferring to a father's will.
For 'tis the hope of parents they may rear
A brood of sons submissive, keen to avenge
Their father's wrongs, and count his friends their own.
But who begets unprofitable sons,
He verily breeds trouble for himself,
And for his foes much laughter.  Son, be warned
And let no woman fool away thy wits.
Ill fares the husband mated with a shrew,
And her embraces very soon wax cold.
For what can wound so surely to the quick
As a false friend?  So spue and cast her off,
Bid her go find a husband with the dead.
For since I caught her openly rebelling,
Of all my subjects the one malcontent,
I will not prove a traitor to the State.
She surely dies.  Go, let her, if she will,
Appeal to Zeus the God of Kindred, for
If thus I nurse rebellion in my house,
Shall not I foster mutiny without?
For whoso rules his household worthily,
Will prove in civic matters no less wise.
But he who overbears the laws, or thinks
To overrule his rulers, such as one
I never will allow.  Whome'er the State
Appoints must be obeyed in everything,
But small and great, just and unjust alike.
I warrant such a one in either case
Would shine, as King or subject; such a man
Would in the storm of battle stand his ground,
A comrade leal and true; but Anarchy--
What evils are not wrought by Anarchy!
She ruins States, and overthrows the home,
She dissipates and routs the embattled host;
While discipline preserves the ordered ranks.
Therefore we must maintain authority
And yield to title to a woman's will.
Better, if needs be, men should cast us out
Than hear it said, a woman proved his match.

CHORUS
To me, unless old age have dulled wits,
Thy words appear both reasonable and wise.

HAEMON
Father, the gods implant in mortal men
Reason, the choicest gift bestowed by heaven.
'Tis not for me to say thou errest, nor
Would I arraign thy wisdom, if I could;
And yet wise thoughts may come to other men
And, as thy son, it falls to me to mark
The acts, the words, the comments of the crowd.
The commons stand in terror of thy frown,
And dare not utter aught that might offend,
But I can overhear their muttered plaints,
Know how the people mourn this maiden doomed
For noblest deeds to die the worst of deaths.
When her own brother slain in battle lay
Unsepulchered, she suffered not his corse
To lie for carrion birds and dogs to maul:
Should not her name (they cry) be writ in gold?
Such the low murmurings that reach my ear.
O father, nothing is by me more prized
Than thy well-being, for what higher good
Can children covet than their sire's fair fame,
As fathers too take pride in glorious sons?
Therefore, my father, cling not to one mood,
And deemed not thou art right, all others wrong.
For whoso thinks that wisdom dwells with him,
That he alone can speak or think aright,
Such oracles are empty breath when tried.
The wisest man will let himself be swayed
By others' wisdom and relax in time.
See how the trees beside a stream in flood
Save, if they yield to force, each spray unharmed,
But by resisting perish root and branch.
The mariner who keeps his mainsheet taut,
And will not slacken in the gale, is like
To sail with thwarts reversed, keel uppermost.
Relent then and repent thee of thy wrath;
For, if one young in years may claim some sense,
I'll say 'tis best of all to be endowed
With absolute wisdom; but, if that's denied,
(And nature takes not readily that ply)
Next wise is he who lists to sage advice.

CHORUS
If he says aught in season, heed him, King.
(To HAEMON)
Heed thou thy sire too; both have spoken well.

CREON
What, would you have us at our age be schooled,
Lessoned in prudence by a beardless boy?

HAEMON
I plead for justice, father, nothing more.
Weigh me upon my merit, not my years.

CREON
Strange merit this to sanction lawlessness!

HAEMON
For evil-doers I would urge no plea.

CREON
Is not this maid an arrant law-breaker?

HAEMON
The Theban commons with one voice say, No.

CREON
What, shall the mob dictate my policy?

HAEMON
'Tis thou, methinks, who speakest like a boy.

CREON
Am I to rule for others, or myself?

HAEMON
A State for one man is no State at all.

CREON
The State is his who rules it, so 'tis held.

HAEMON
As monarch of a desert thou wouldst shine.

CREON
This boy, methinks, maintains the woman's cause.

HAEMON
If thou be'st woman, yes.  My thought's for thee.

CREON
O reprobate, would'st wrangle with thy sire?

HAEMON
Because I see thee wrongfully perverse.

CREON
And am I wrong, if I maintain my rights?

HAEMON
Talk not of rights; thou spurn'st the due of Heaven

CREON
O heart corrupt, a woman's minion thou!

HAEMON
Slave to dishonor thou wilt never find me.

CREON
Thy speech at least was all a plea for her.

HAEMON
And thee and me, and for the gods below.

CREON
Living the maid shall never be thy bride.

HAEMON
So she shall die, but one will die with her.

CREON
Hast come to such a pass as threaten me?

HAEMON
What threat is this, vain counsels to reprove?

CREON
Vain fool to instruct thy betters; thou shall rue it.

HAEMON
Wert not my father, I had said thou err'st.

CREON
Play not the spaniel, thou a woman's slave.

HAEMON
When thou dost speak, must no man make reply?

CREON
This passes bounds.  By heaven, thou shalt not rate
And jeer and flout me with impunity.
Off with the hateful thing that she may die
At once, beside her bridegroom, in his sight.

HAEMON
Think not that in my sight the maid shall die,
Or by my side; never shalt thou again
Behold my face hereafter.  Go, consort
With friends who like a madman for their mate.
[Exit HAEMON]

CHORUS
Thy son has gone, my liege, in angry haste.
Fell is the wrath of youth beneath a smart.

CREON
Let him go vent his fury like a fiend:
These sisters twain he shall not save from death.

CHORUS
Surely, thou meanest not to slay them both?

CREON
I stand corrected; only her who touched
The body.

CHORUS
          And what death is she to die?

CREON
She shall be taken to some desert place
By man untrod, and in a rock-hewn cave,
With food no more than to avoid the taint
That homicide might bring on all the State,
Buried alive.  There let her call in aid
The King of Death, the one god she reveres,
Or learn too late a lesson learnt at last:
'Tis labor lost, to reverence the dead.

CHORUS
(Str.)
Love resistless in fight, all yield at a glance of thine eye,
Love who pillowed all night on a maiden's cheek dost lie,
Over the upland holds.  Shall mortals not yield to thee?

(Ant).
Mad are thy subjects all, and even the wisest heart
Straight to folly will fall, at a touch of thy poisoned dart.
Thou didst kindle the strife, this feud of kinsman with kin,
By the eyes of a winsome wife, and the yearning her heart to win.
For as her consort still, enthroned with Justice above,
Thou bendest man to thy will, O all invincible Love.

          Lo I myself am borne aside,
          From Justice, as I view this bride.
          (O sight an eye in tears to drown)
          Antigone, so young, so fair,
               Thus hurried down
          Death's bower with the dead to share.

ANTIGONE
(Str. 1)
Friends, countrymen, my last farewell I make;
          My journey's done.
One last fond, lingering, longing look I take
          At the bright sun.
For Death who puts to sleep both young and old
          Hales my young life,
And beckons me to Acheron's dark fold,
          An unwed wife.
No youths have sung the marriage song for me,
          My bridal bed
No maids have strewn with flowers from the lea,
          'Tis Death I wed.

CHORUS
          But bethink thee, thou art sped,
          Great and glorious, to the dead.
          Thou the sword's edge hast not tasted,
          No disease thy frame hath wasted.
          Freely thou alone shalt go
          Living to the dead below.

ANTIGONE
(Ant. 1)
Nay, but the piteous tale I've heard men tell
     Of Tantalus' doomed child,
Chained upon Siphylus' high rocky fell,
     That clung like ivy wild,
Drenched by the pelting rain and whirling snow,
     Left there to pine,
While on her frozen breast the tears aye flow--
     Her fate is mine.

CHORUS
          She was sprung of gods, divine,
          Mortals we of mortal line.
          Like renown with gods to gain
          Recompenses all thy pain.
          Take this solace to thy tomb
          Hers in life and death thy doom.

ANTIGONE
(Str. 2)
Alack, alack!  Ye mock me.  Is it meet
     Thus to insult me living, to my face?
Cease, by our country's altars I entreat,
     Ye lordly rulers of a lordly race.
O fount of Dirce, wood-embowered plain
     Where Theban chariots to victory speed,
Mark ye the cruel laws that now have wrought my bane,
     The friends who show no pity in my need!
Was ever fate like mine?  O monstrous doom,
     Within a rock-built prison sepulchered,
To fade and wither in a living tomb,
     And alien midst the living and the dead.

CHORUS
(Str. 3)
          In thy boldness over-rash
          Madly thou thy foot didst dash
          'Gainst high Justice' altar stair.
          Thou a father's guild dost bear.

ANTIGONE
(Ant. 2)
At this thou touchest my most poignant pain,
     My ill-starred father's piteous disgrace,
The taint of blood, the hereditary stain,
     That clings to all of Labdacus' famed race.
Woe worth the monstrous marriage-bed where lay
     A mother with the son her womb had borne,
Therein I was conceived, woe worth the day,
     Fruit of incestuous sheets, a maid forlorn,
And now I pass, accursed and unwed,
     To meet them as an alien there below;
And thee, O brother, in marriage ill-bestead,
     'Twas thy dead hand that dealt me this death-blow.

CHORUS
          Religion has her chains, 'tis true,
          Let rite be paid when rites are due.
          Yet is it ill to disobey
          The powers who hold by might the sway.
          Thou hast withstood authority,
          A self-willed rebel, thou must die.

ANTIGONE
Unwept, unwed, unfriended, hence I go,
     No longer may I see the day's bright eye;
Not one friend left to share my bitter woe,
     And o'er my ashes heave one passing sigh.

CREON
If wail and lamentation aught availed
To stave off death, I trow they'd never end.
Away with her, and having walled her up
In a rock-vaulted tomb, as I ordained,
Leave her alone at liberty to die,
Or, if she choose, to live in solitude,
The tomb her dwelling.  We in either case
Are guiltless as concerns this maiden's blood,
Only on earth no lodging shall she find.

ANTIGONE
O grave, O bridal bower, O prison house
Hewn from the rock, my everlasting home,
Whither I go to join the mighty host
Of kinsfolk, Persephassa's guests long dead,
The last of all, of all more miserable,
I pass, my destined span of years cut short.
And yet good hope is mine that I shall find
A welcome from my sire, a welcome too,
From thee, my mother, and my brother dear;
From with these hands, I laved and decked your limbs
In death, and poured libations on your grave.
And last, my Polyneices, unto thee
I paid due rites, and this my recompense!
Yet am I justified in wisdom's eyes.
For even had it been some child of mine,
Or husband mouldering in death's decay,
I had not wrought this deed despite the State.
What is the law I call in aid?  'Tis thus
I argue.  Had it been a husband dead
I might have wed another, and have borne
Another child, to take the dead child's place.
But, now my sire and mother both are dead,
No second brother can be born for me.
Thus by the law of conscience I was led
To honor thee, dear brother, and was judged
By Creon guilty of a heinous crime.
And now he drags me like a criminal,
A bride unwed, amerced of marriage-song
And marriage-bed and joys of motherhood,
By friends deserted to a living grave.
What ordinance of heaven have I transgressed?
Hereafter can I look to any god
For succor, call on any man for help?
Alas, my piety is impious deemed.
Well, if such justice is approved of heaven,
I shall be taught by suffering my sin;
But if the sin is theirs, O may they suffer
No worse ills than the wrongs they do to me.

CHORUS
The same ungovernable will
Drives like a gale the maiden still.

CREON
Therefore, my guards who let her stay
Shall smart full sore for their delay.

ANTIGONE
Ah, woe is me!  This word I hear
Brings death most near.

CHORUS
I have no comfort.  What he saith,
Portends no other thing than death.

ANTIGONE
My fatherland, city of Thebes divine,
Ye gods of Thebes whence sprang my line,
Look, puissant lords of Thebes, on me;
The last of all your royal house ye see.
Martyred by men of sin, undone.
Such meed my piety hath won.
[Exit ANTIGONE]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Like to thee that maiden bright,
          Danae, in her brass-bound tower,
Once exchanged the glad sunlight
          For a cell, her bridal bower.
And yet she sprang of royal line,
          My child, like thine,
          And nursed the seed
          By her conceived
Of Zeus descending in a golden shower.
Strange are the ways of Fate, her power
Nor wealth, nor arms withstand, nor tower;
Nor brass-prowed ships, that breast the sea
          From Fate can flee.

(Ant. 1)
Thus Dryas' child, the rash Edonian King,
For words of high disdain
Did Bacchus to a rocky dungeon bring,
To cool the madness of a fevered brain.
          His frenzy passed,
          He learnt at last
'Twas madness gibes against a god to fling.
For once he fain had quenched the Maenad's fire;
And of the tuneful Nine provoked the ire.

(Str. 2)
By the Iron Rocks that guard the double main,
          On Bosporus' lone strand,
Where stretcheth Salmydessus' plain
          In the wild Thracian land,
There on his borders Ares witnessed
          The vengeance by a jealous step-dame ta'en
The gore that trickled from a spindle red,
          The sightless orbits of her step-sons twain.

(Ant. 2)
Wasting away they mourned their piteous doom,
The blasted issue of their mother's womb.
But she her lineage could trace
          To great Erecththeus' race;
Daughter of Boreas in her sire's vast caves
          Reared, where the tempest raves,
Swift as his horses o'er the hills she sped;
A child of gods; yet she, my child, like thee,
               By Destiny
That knows not death nor age--she too was vanquished.
[Enter TEIRESIAS and BOY]

TEIRESIAS
Princes of Thebes, two wayfarers as one,
Having betwixt us eyes for one, we are here.
The blind man cannot move without a guide.

CREON
Why tidings, old Teiresias?

TEIRESIAS
                              I will tell thee;
And when thou hearest thou must heed the seer.

CREON
Thus far I ne'er have disobeyed thy rede.

TEIRESIAS
So hast thou steered the ship of State aright.

CREON
I know it, and I gladly own my debt.

TEIRESIAS
Bethink thee that thou treadest once again
The razor edge of peril.

CREON
                         What is this?
Thy words inspire a dread presentiment.

TEIRESIAS
The divination of my arts shall tell.
Sitting upon my throne of augury,
As is my wont, where every fowl of heaven
Find harborage, upon mine ears was borne
A jargon strange of twitterings, hoots, and screams;
So knew I that each bird at the other tare
With bloody talons, for the whirr of wings
Could signify naught else.  Perturbed in soul,
I straight essayed the sacrifice by fire
On blazing altars, but the God of Fire
Came not in flame, and from the thigh bones dripped
And sputtered in the ashes a foul ooze;
Gall-bladders cracked and spurted up:  the fat
Melted and fell and left the thigh bones bare.
Such are the signs, taught by this lad, I read--
As I guide others, so the boy guides me--
The frustrate signs of oracles grown dumb.
O King, thy willful temper ails the State,
For all our shrines and altars are profaned
By what has filled the maw of dogs and crows,
The flesh of Oedipus' unburied son.
Therefore the angry gods abominate
Our litanies and our burnt offerings;
Therefore no birds trill out a happy note,
Gorged with the carnival of human gore.
O ponder this, my son.  To err is common
To all men, but the man who having erred
Hugs not his errors, but repents and seeks
The cure, is not a wastrel nor unwise.
No fool, the saw goes, like the obstinate fool.
Let death disarm thy vengeance.  O forbear
To vex the dead.  What glory wilt thou win
By slaying twice the slain?  I mean thee well;
Counsel's most welcome if I promise gain.

CREON
Old man, ye all let fly at me your shafts
Like anchors at a target; yea, ye set
Your soothsayer on me.  Peddlers are ye all
And I the merchandise ye buy and sell.
Go to, and make your profit where ye will,
Silver of Sardis change for gold of Ind;
Ye will not purchase this man's burial,
Not though the winged ministers of Zeus
Should bear him in their talons to his throne;
Not e'en in awe of prodigy so dire
Would I permit his burial, for I know
No human soilure can assail the gods;
This too I know, Teiresias, dire's the fall
Of craft and cunning when it tries to gloss
Foul treachery with fair words for filthy gain.

TEIRESIAS
Alas! doth any know and lay to heart--

CREON
Is this the prelude to some hackneyed saw?

TEIRESIAS
How far good counsel is the best of goods?

CREON
True, as unwisdom is the worst of ills.

TEIRESIAS
Thou art infected with that ill thyself.

CREON
I will not bandy insults with thee, seer.

TEIRESIAS
And yet thou say'st my prophesies are frauds.

CREON
Prophets are all a money-getting tribe.

TEIRESIAS
And kings are all a lucre-loving race.

CREON
Dost know at whom thou glancest, me thy lord?

TEIRESIAS
Lord of the State and savior, thanks to me.

CREON
Skilled prophet art thou, but to wrong inclined.

TEIRESIAS
Take heed, thou wilt provoke me to reveal
The mystery deep hidden in my breast.

CREON
Say on, but see it be not said for gain.

TEIRESIAS
Such thou, methinks, till now hast judged my words.

CREON
Be sure thou wilt not traffic on my wits.

TEIRESIAS
Know then for sure, the coursers of the sun
Not many times shall run their race, before
Thou shalt have given the fruit of thine own loins
In quittance of thy murder, life for life;
For that thou hast entombed a living soul,
And sent below a denizen of earth,
And wronged the nether gods by leaving here
A corpse unlaved, unwept, unsepulchered.
Herein thou hast no part, nor e'en the gods
In heaven; and thou usurp'st a power not thine.
For this the avenging spirits of Heaven and Hell
Who dog the steps of sin are on thy trail:
What these have suffered thou shalt suffer too.
And now, consider whether bought by gold
I prophesy.  For, yet a little while,
And sound of lamentation shall be heard,
Of men and women through thy desolate halls;
And all thy neighbor States are leagues to avenge
Their mangled warriors who have found a grave
I' the maw of wolf or hound, or winged bird
That flying homewards taints their city's air.
These are the shafts, that like a bowman I
Provoked to anger, loosen at thy breast,
Unerring, and their smart thou shalt not shun.
Boy, lead me home, that he may vent his spleen
On younger men, and learn to curb his tongue
With gentler manners than his present mood.
[Exit TEIRESIAS]

CHORUS
My liege, that man hath gone, foretelling woe.
And, O believe me, since these grizzled locks
Were like the raven, never have I known
The prophet's warning to the State to fail.

CREON
I know it too, and it perplexes me.
To yield is grievous, but the obstinate soul
That fights with Fate, is smitten grievously.

CHORUS
Son of Menoeceus, list to good advice.

CHORUS
What should I do.  Advise me.  I will heed.

CHORUS
Go, free the maiden from her rocky cell;
And for the unburied outlaw build a tomb.

CREON
Is that your counsel?  You would have me yield?

CHORUS
Yea, king, this instant.  Vengeance of the gods
Is swift to overtake the impenitent.

CREON
Ah! what a wrench it is to sacrifice
My heart's resolve; but Fate is ill to fight.

CHORUS
Go, trust not others.  Do it quick thyself.

CREON
I go hot-foot.  Bestir ye one and all,
My henchmen!  Get ye axes!  Speed away
To yonder eminence!  I too will go,
For all my resolution this way sways.
'Twas I that bound, I too will set her free.
Almost I am persuaded it is best
To keep through life the law ordained of old.
[Exit CREON]

CHORUS
(Str. 1)
Thou by many names adored,
          Child of Zeus the God of thunder,
          Of a Theban bride the wonder,
Fair Italia's guardian lord;

In the deep-embosomed glades
          Of the Eleusinian Queen
Haunt of revelers, men and maids,
          Dionysus, thou art seen.

Where Ismenus rolls his waters,
          Where the Dragon's teeth were sown,
Where the Bacchanals thy daughters
          Round thee roam,
          There thy home;
Thebes, O Bacchus, is thine own.

(Ant. 1)
Thee on the two-crested rock
          Lurid-flaming torches see;
Where Corisian maidens flock,
          Thee the springs of Castaly.

By Nysa's bastion ivy-clad,
By shores with clustered vineyards glad,
There to thee the hymn rings out,
And through our streets we Thebans shout,
          All hall to thee
          Evoe, Evoe!

(Str. 2)
Oh, as thou lov'st this city best of all,
To thee, and to thy Mother levin-stricken,
In our dire need we call;
Thou see'st with what a plague our townsfolk sicken.
          Thy ready help we crave,
Whether adown Parnassian heights descending,
Or o'er the roaring straits thy swift was wending,
          Save us, O save!

(Ant. 2)
Brightest of all the orbs that breathe forth light,
     Authentic son of Zeus, immortal king,
Leader of all the voices of the night,
     Come, and thy train of Thyiads with thee bring,
          Thy maddened rout
Who dance before thee all night long, and shout,
          Thy handmaids we,
          Evoe, Evoe!

[Enter MESSENGER]

MESSENGER
Attend all ye who dwell beside the halls
Of Cadmus and Amphion.  No man's life
As of one tenor would I praise or blame,
For Fortune with a constant ebb and rise
Casts down and raises high and low alike,
And none can read a mortal's horoscope.
Take Creon; he, methought, if any man,
Was enviable.  He had saved this land
Of Cadmus from our enemies and attained
A monarch's powers and ruled the state supreme,
While a right noble issue crowned his bliss.
Now all is gone and wasted, for a life
Without life's joys I count a living death.
You'll tell me he has ample store of wealth,
The pomp and circumstance of kings; but if
These give no pleasure, all the rest I count
The shadow of a shade, nor would I weigh
His wealth and power 'gainst a dram of joy.

CHORUS
What fresh woes bring'st thou to the royal house?

MESSENGER
Both dead, and they who live deserve to die.

CHORUS
Who is the slayer, who the victim? speak.

MESSENGER
Haemon; his blood shed by no stranger hand.

CHORUS
What mean ye? by his father's or his own?

MESSENGER
His own; in anger for his father's crime.

CHORUS
O prophet, what thou spakest comes to pass.

MESSENGER
So stands the case; now 'tis for you to act.

CHORUS
Lo! from the palace gates I see approaching
Creon's unhappy wife, Eurydice.
Comes she by chance or learning her son's fate?
[Enter EURYDICE]

EURYDICE
Ye men of Thebes, I overheard your talk.
As I passed out to offer up my prayer
To Pallas, and was drawing back the bar
To open wide the door, upon my ears
There broke a wail that told of household woe
Stricken with terror in my handmaids' arms
I fell and fainted.  But repeat your tale
To one not unacquaint with misery.

MESSENGER
Dear mistress, I was there and will relate
The perfect truth, omitting not one word.
Why should we gloze and flatter, to be proved
Liars hereafter?  Truth is ever best.
Well, in attendance on my liege, your lord,
I crossed the plain to its utmost margin, where
The corse of Polyneices, gnawn and mauled,
Was lying yet.  We offered first a prayer
To Pluto and the goddess of cross-ways,
With contrite hearts, to deprecate their ire.
Then laved with lustral waves the mangled corse,
Laid it on fresh-lopped branches, lit a pyre,
And to his memory piled a mighty mound
Of mother earth.  Then to the caverned rock,
The bridal chamber of the maid and Death,
We sped, about to enter.  But a guard
Heard from that godless shrine a far shrill wail,
And ran back to our lord to tell the news.
But as he nearer drew a hollow sound
Of lamentation to the King was borne.
He groaned and uttered then this bitter plaint:
"Am I a prophet? miserable me!
Is this the saddest path I ever trod?
'Tis my son's voice that calls me.  On press on,
My henchmen, haste with double speed to the tomb
Where rocks down-torn have made a gap, look in
And tell me if in truth I recognize
The voice of Haemon or am heaven-deceived."
So at the bidding of our distraught lord
We looked, and in the craven's vaulted gloom
I saw the maiden lying strangled there,
A noose of linen twined about her neck;
And hard beside her, clasping her cold form,
Her lover lay bewailing his dead bride
Death-wedded, and his father's cruelty.
When the King saw him, with a terrible groan
He moved towards him, crying, "O my son
What hast thou done?  What ailed thee?  What mischance
Has reft thee of thy reason?  O come forth,
Come forth, my son; thy father supplicates."
But the son glared at him with tiger eyes,
Spat in his face, and then, without a word,
Drew his two-hilted sword and smote, but missed
His father flying backwards.  Then the boy,
Wroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent
Fell on his sword and drove it through his side
Home, but yet breathing clasped in his lax arms
The maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined
With his expiring gasps.  So there they lay
Two corpses, one in death.  His marriage rites
Are consummated in the halls of Death:
A witness that of ills whate'er befall
Mortals' unwisdom is the worst of all.
[Exit EURYDICE]

CHORUS
What makest thou of this?  The Queen has gone
Without a word importing good or ill.

MESSENGER
I marvel too, but entertain good hope.
'Tis that she shrinks in public to lament
Her son's sad ending, and in privacy
Would with her maidens mourn a private loss.
Trust me, she is discreet and will not err.

CHORUS
I know not, but strained silence, so I deem,
Is no less ominous than excessive grief.

MESSENGER
Well, let us to the house and solve our doubts,
Whether the tumult of her heart conceals
Some fell design.  It may be thou art right:
Unnatural silence signifies no good.

CHORUS
          Lo! the King himself appears.
          Evidence he with him bears
          'Gainst himself (ah me! I quake
          'Gainst a king such charge to make)
          But all must own,
          The guilt is his and his alone.

CREON
(Str. 1)
          Woe for sin of minds perverse,
          Deadly fraught with mortal curse.
          Behold us slain and slayers, all akin.
          Woe for my counsel dire, conceived in sin.
               Alas, my son,
               Life scarce begun,
               Thou wast undone.
          The fault was mine, mine only, O my son!

CHORUS
Too late thou seemest to perceive the truth.

CREON
(Str. 2)
By sorrow schooled.  Heavy the hand of God,
Thorny and rough the paths my feet have trod,
Humbled my pride, my pleasure turned to pain;
Poor mortals, how we labor all in vain!
[Enter SECOND MESSENGER]

SECOND MESSENGER
Sorrows are thine, my lord, and more to come,
One lying at thy feet, another yet
More grievous waits thee, when thou comest home.

CREON
What woe is lacking to my tale of woes?

SECOND MESSENGER
Thy wife, the mother of thy dead son here,
Lies stricken by a fresh inflicted blow.

CREON
(Ant. 1)
     How bottomless the pit!
          Does claim me too, O Death?
          What is this word he saith,
     This woeful messenger?  Say, is it fit
     To slay anew a man already slain?
          Is Death at work again,
     Stroke upon stroke, first son, then mother slain?

CHORUS
Look for thyself.  She lies for all to view.

CREON
(Ant. 2)
Alas! another added woe I see.
What more remains to crown my agony?
A minute past I clasped a lifeless son,
And now another victim Death hath won.
Unhappy mother, most unhappy son!

SECOND MESSENGER
Beside the altar on a keen-edged sword
She fell and closed her eyes in night, but erst
She mourned for Megareus who nobly died
Long since, then for her son; with her last breath
She cursed thee, the slayer of her child.

CREON
(Str. 3)
          I shudder with affright
O for a two-edged sword to slay outright
          A wretch like me,
          Made one with misery.

SECOND MESSENGER
'Tis true that thou wert charged by the dead Queen
As author of both deaths, hers and her son's.

CREON
In what wise was her self-destruction wrought?

SECOND MESSENGER
Hearing the loud lament above her son
With her own hand she stabbed herself to the heart.

CREON
(Str. 4)
I am the guilty cause.  I did the deed,
Thy murderer.  Yea, I guilty plead.
My henchmen, lead me hence, away, away,
A cipher, less than nothing; no delay!

CHORUS
Well said, if in disaster aught is well
His past endure demand the speediest cure.

CREON
(Ant. 3)
          Come, Fate, a friend at need,
          Come with all speed!
          Come, my best friend,
          And speed my end!
          Away, away!
Let me not look upon another day!

CHORUS
This for the morrow; to us are present needs
That they whom it concerns must take in hand.

CREON
I join your prayer that echoes my desire.

CHORUS
O pray not, prayers are idle; from the doom
Of fate for mortals refuge is there none.

CREON
(Ant. 4)
Away with me, a worthless wretch who slew
Unwitting thee, my son, thy mother too.
Whither to turn I know now; every way
          Leads but astray,
And on my head I feel the heavy weight
          Of crushing Fate.

CHORUS
     Of happiness the chiefest part
          Is a wise heart:
     And to defraud the gods in aught
          With peril's fraught.
     Swelling words of high-flown might
     Mightily the gods do smite.
     Chastisement for errors past
     Wisdom brings to age at last.

FADE IN:

EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL – NIGHT

The front of the affluent Southern California school gleams darkly in the moonlight.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – CONTINUOUS

TRACK through the hall. Nothing.

CUT TO:
INT. CLASSROOM – CONTINUOUS

Silent.

We track along the wall, past the maps and drawings tacked up on it, past the window, which SHATTERS in our faces!

It’s just a single pane, knocked in by someone’s hand. It unlocks the window and slides it up.

The intrude is a college age BOY, a timid GIRL beside him. She looks about nervously.

GIRL
Are you sure this is a good idea?
BOY
It’s a great idea! Come on.

As they climb in.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – A MOMENT LATER

He leads her out here. It’s even darker than the classroom

GIRL
You go to school here?
BOY
Used to.
On top of the gym, it’s so cool – you can see the whole town.

GIRL
I don’t want to go up there.

BOY
Oh, you can’t wait, huh?

He moves to kiss her.

GIRL
We’re just gonna get in trouble
BOY
Count on it.

He kisses her, but she turns suddenly, real fear crossing her face.

GIRL
What was that?
BOY
What was what?

GIRL
I heard a noise.

BOY
It’s nothing.

GIRL
Maybe it’s something…

BOY
Maybe it’s some Thing...

GIRL
That’s not funny.

He looks about them. The place is dark, shadowy. She cowers behind him.

BOY
Hello…?
Silence.

BOY
There’s nobody here.
GIRL
Are you sure?

BOY
I’m sure.

GIRL
Okay…

She bares HORRIBLE FANGS and BURIES them in his neck.

EXT. NIGHT – AN ALLEY (THE DREAM)
CLOSE UP: SHOES

A poor man’s shoes, walking down the alley. Echoing in the emptiness.

ANGLE: THE MAN

Walking tentatively, far away. Suddenly the camera RUSHES at him like a predator – he turns just as it reaches him and –

ANGLE: A CANDLE BLOWING OUT.

We HEAR CHILDREN CHANTING a schoolyard song eerily in the blackness, on top of sinister WHISPERS, and we see

ANGLE: THE ALLEY

And the man, face down, unable to crawl, clawing his way along the ground in terror – and his body is YANKED out of frame with incredible speed.

ANGLE: A GIRL IN BED

Tossing and turning, as the camera moves down to reveal the shadow of someone – something – approaching her – and we hear an impossibly low voice:

I’ll take you… like a cancer…
I’ll get inside you and eat my way out…

ROARS out of the shadows and we

CUT TO:
INT. BUFFY’S BEDROOM – MORNING

Her eyes snap open. Despite the morning light, we recognize the girl – and the bed – from the dream. A moment, as she gets her bearings, shakes off the immediacy of the dream.

BUFFY’S MOM (O.S.)
Buffy…
BUFFY
I’m up, mom.

BUFFY’S MOM (O.S.)
Don’t want to be late for your first day.

BUFFY
(to herself)
No… wouldn’t want that…

Her voice betrays her uncertainty. She sits up. A wider angle on her room reveals that it’s only half decorated: there are still boxes as yet unpacked in the corner.

CUT TO:
EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL – MORNING

A day as bright and colorful as the night was black and eerie. Students pour in before first bell, talking, laughing. They could be from anywhere in America, but for the extremity of their dress and the esoteric mania of their slang. This is definitely So Cal.

ANGLE: A CAR

Pulls up outside the school. Buffy’s mom, JOYCE, is driving. Buffy gets out the passenger side.

JOYCE
Now, you have a good time. I know you’ll make friends right away.
Think positive. And honey… try not to get kicked out.
BUFFY
I promise.

The girl turns, looks at the school. She starts in as her mother drives away.

ANGLE: A SKATEBOARD

Weaving along the road. On it is XANDER, dressed with the shaggy indifference common to skateboarders.

He is bright, funny, and will one day be suave and handsome. Till that day arrives, he’ll do the best he can with bright and funny.

He weaves through a thickening mass of students toward the school.

XANDER
Coming through… Coming through…
(as the crowd increases)
Not certain how to stop…
But he’s doing okay until he passes Buffy – intrigued by the new face, he cranes to look at her, and nearly takes a header. He saves himself from falling, however, coming to a stop just in front of:

WILLOW. She is shy, bookish, and very possibly dressed by her mother. The intelligence in her eyes and the sweetness of her smile belie a genuine charm that is lost on the unsubtle high school mind. It’s certainly lost on Xander, though he brightens considerably to see her. The new face forgotten, at least for now.

XANDER
Willow! You’re so much the person I wanted to see.
Her excitement at the sentiment is sweetly pathetic, and typically unnoticed.

WILLOW
Really?
XANDER
Yeah. You know, I kind of had a problem with the math.

WILLOW
(hiding disappointment)
Which part?

XANDER
The math. Can you help me tonight?
Please? Be my study buddy?

WILLOW
Well, what’s in it for me?

XANDER
A shiny nickel…

WILLOW
Okay. Do you have “Theories in Trig?” You should check it out.

XANDER
Check it out?

WILLOW
From the library. Where the books live.

XANDER
Right. I’m there. See, I want to change.

INT. SCHOOL HALL – CONTINUOUS

They are approached by JESSE, their bud. He is a little more awkward than Xander, a little less likely to become a lady killer in his later years.

JESSE
Hey.
XANDER
Jesse! What’s what.

JESSE
New girl!

XANDER
That’s right, I saw her. She’s pretty much a hotty.

WILLOW
I heard someone was transferring here.

XANDER
So. Tell.

JESSE
Tell what?

XANDER
What’s the sitch? What do you know about her?

JESSE
(“that’s all”)
New girl.

XANDER
Well, you’re certainly a font of nothing.

CUT TO:
INT. BOB FLUTIE’S OFFICE – CONTINUOUS

Buffy sits before principal FLUTIE. He is middle aged, a tad officious. Caught between the old school of strict discipline and the new school of sensitivity.

He pulls her transcript from a folder. He looks at it, looks at her.

MR FLUTIE
Buffy Summers. Sophomore, late of Hemery High in Los Angeles.
Interesting record. Quite a career.
He smiles, and carefully tears up her transcript up into four pieces.

MR FLUTIE
Welcome to Sunnydale. A clean slate, Buffy, that’s what you get here. What’s past is past.
We’re not interested in what it says on a piece of paper.
Even if it says
(looks down at a piece, reacts)
-- whoa. At Sunnydale we nurture the whole student. The inner student.
He is taking the pieces of the transcript as he talks and carefully placing them together again.

MR FLUTIE
Other schools might looks at the incredible decline in grade point average – we look at the
struggling young woman with the incredible decline in grade point average. Other schools might
look at the reports of gang fights –
BUFFY
Mr. Flutie –

MR FLUTIE
All the kids here are free to call me Bob –

BUFFY
Bob –

MR FLUTIE
--but they don’t.

He pulls out a piece of tape, starts taping the transcript back together.

BUFFY
Mr. Flutie. I know my transcripts are a little colorful –
MR FLUTIE
Hey, we’re not caring about that! Do you think “colorful” is the word? Not “dismal”? Just off
hand, I’d go with “dismal.”

BUFFY
It wasn’t that bad.

MR FLUTIE
You burned down the gym.

BUFFY
I did. I really did. But you gotta see the big picture. I mean, the gym was full of vamp… uh,
asbestos.

MR FLUTIE
Buffy. Don’t worry. Any other school, they might say “watch your step”, or, “we’ll be watching
you” or, “get within a hundred yards of the gym with a book of matches and you’ll grow up in
juvie hall” but that’s just not the way here. We want to service your needs, and help you to
respect our needs. And if you needs and our needs don’t mesh…

Still smiling blandly, he slips the taped up transcript back in her folder.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – A MOMENT LATER

Buffy exits to office, looking a bit depressed. She starts rummaging through her bag and a student runs by, bumps into her. Her books and stuff spill out. Frustrated, she kneels down, starts scooping it back in.

Xander sees this, goes up to her, kneeling.

XANDER
Can I have you? Dyeh – can I help you?
BUFFY
Oh, thanks…

He starts picking things up, handing them to her.

XANDER
I don’t know you, do I?
BUFFY
I’m new. I’m Buffy.

XANDER
Xander. Is me. Hi.

BUFFY
Thanks.

XANDER
Maybe I’ll see you around. Maybe at school, since we both… go there…

BUFFY
Great. Nice to meet you.

He gives her the rest of her books. She stuffs it all in her bag and hurries away.

XANDER
“We both go to school…” Very suave. Very not pathetic.
He notices something on the floor, bends down to get it. Calls after her:

XANDER
Oh, hey, you forgot your…
(looks at the thing in his hand)
…stake…
But she’s too far off to hear. He looks at the wooden stake, puzzled.

CUT TO:
INT. HISTORY CLASS – MORNING

THE TEACHER is in front, lecturing. We hear her mostly in voice over as we see Buffy near the back, earnestly taking notes. Trying to keep up.

TEACHER
It’s estimated that about 25 million people died in that one four year span. But the fun part of the
Black Plague is that it originated in Europe how? As an early form of germ warfare. The plague
was first found in Asia, and a Kipchak army actually catapulted plague-infested corpses into a 
Genoese trading post. Ingenious. If you look at the map on page 63 you can trace the spread of
the disease…
Buffy looks about as kids open their books – she hasn’t got one. The girl next to her, CORDELIA, leans over. She is pretty, self assured. Killer outfit.

CORDELIA
Here.
She moves her book over so Buffy can read off it as well.

BUFFY
Thanks.
TEACHER
And this popular plague led to what social changes?

CUT TO:
INT. SAME – END OF CLASS

Kids are piling up their books and leaving as the bell RINGS. Cordelia introduces herself:

CORDELIA
Hi, I’m Cordelia.
BUFFY
I’m Buffy.

CORDELIA
If you’re looking for a textbook of your very own, there’s probably a few in the Library.

BUFFY
Oh, great. Thanks. Where would that be?

CORDELIA
I’ll show you.

As the girls walk through the crowded hall.

CORDELIA
You transferred from Hemery, right? In L.A.?
BUFFY
Yeah.

CORDELIA
Oh! I would kill to live in L.A. 
Being that close to that many shoes… Why’d you come here?

BUFFY
Because my Mom moved, is the reason. I mean we both moved. But my Mom wanted to.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – CONTINUOUS

CORDELIA
Well, you’ll be okay here. If you hang with me and mine you’ll be accepted in no time. Of
course we do have to test your coolness factor. You’re from L.A., so you can skip the written,
but, let’s see… Vamp nail polish.
BUFFY
(tentatively)
Over?

CORDELIA
SO over. James Spader.

BUFFY
He needs to call me.

CORDELIA
Trendy but tasty.
John Tesh.

BUFFY
The Devil?

CORDELIA
Well, that was pretty much a gimme, but you passed.

BUFFY
Oh, good.

They stop at the water fountain, which is being used by:

CORDELIA
Willow! Nice dress
(off Willow’s smile)
Good to know you’ve seen the softer side of Sears.
That hurt. Buffy says nothing, surprised by Cordelia’s sudden viciousness. Willow says, almost apologetically:

WILLOW
Well my Mom picked it out.
CORDELIA
(witheringly)
No wonder you’re such a guy-magnet. 
Are you done?

WILLOW
Oh.

She vacates the fountain. Cordy steps up to it, looking at Buffy.

CORDELIA
You wanna fit in here, the first rule is “know your losers”. Once you can identify them all by 
sight, they’re a lot easier to avoid.
She bends down to drink. Buffy looks at the departing Willow, unhappily.

CUT TO:
INT. ANOTHER HALL – A MINUTE LATER

As Buffy and Cordelia walk toward the library.

CORDELIA
--and if you’re not too swamped with catching up you should come out to the Bronze tonight.
BUFFY
The who?

CORDELIA
The Bronze. It’s the only club worth going to around here. They let anybody in but it’s still the
scene. It’s in the bad part of town.

BUFFY
Where’s that?

CORDELIA
About half a block from the good part of town. We don’t have a whole lot of town. You should
show.

They arrive at the entrance to the library.

BUFFY
Well, I’ll try, thanks.
CORDELIA
Good. I’ll see you at gym and you can tell me absolutely everything there is to know about
yourself.

She goes off.

BUFFY
(thrown by the notion)
That sounds like fun…
CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY – CONTINUOUS

Buffy enters, looking about her. It’s elegant, full of dark wood, streaming sunlight, and (duhh) books. It’s also empty. Buffy steps in, looking around. She looks down at the check-out counter to see:

ANGLE: A NEWSPAPER

Folded, with an article on the first page circled in red. The headline reads: LOCAL BOYS STILL MISSING, with a blurry picture of three brothers.

Buffy wanders further in. She peers around a bookcase –

BUFFY
Hello… Is anybody here?
And someone touches her from behind. Startled, she spins.

GILES
Can I help you?
He is British, of middle age, with a quiet intensity.

BUFFY
I was looking for some, well, books. I’m new.
GILES
Miss Summers.

BUFFY
Good call. I guess I’m the only new kid.

GILES
I’m Mr. Giles, the librarian.

BUFFY
Great. So you have, uh, --

GILES
I know what you’re after.

He leads her to the check-out desk by the door. His office can be seen behind it.

He pulls a book out and slides it toward Buffy. Huge leather bound, with a single word set in gild in the cover.

“VAMPYR”

Real concern floods Buffy’s face, along with the understanding. She steps back from the desk, eyes on the librarian.

BUFFY
That’s not what I’m looking for.
GILES
Are you sure?

BUFFY
I’m way sure.

GILES
My mistake.

He replaces the book under the counter.

GILES
So, what is it you said –
But she’s gone.

CUT TO:
INT. WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM – AFTERNOON

Two GIRLS approach their lockers, talking. They begin undressing (just shoes and coats and stuff. Get your mind out of the gutter.)

GIRL #1
The new kid? She seems kind of weird to me. And what kind of name is Buffy?
GIRL #2
Hey, Aphrodesia.

GIRL #1
Hey.

GIRL #3
Well, the chatter in the caf is that she got kicked out and that’s why her mom had to get a new
job.

GIRL #1
Neg.

GIRL #3
Pos. She was starting fights.

GIRL #1
(opening her locker)
Negly!

GIRL #3 [hand written: “- AURA”]
(opening hers)
Well, I heard it from Blue, and she saw the transcripts –

Something FLIES OUT of the locker at her! She SCREAMS as the dead body of the boy from the opening collapses on her, eyes horribly wide.

ANGLE: FROM ABOVE

The body sprawls out on the floor as the girl steps back, screaming for all she’s worth.

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT ONE
Act Two
EXT. FOUNTAIN QUAD – DAY
Willow is carefully taking out her packed lunch (and how healthy it is). Buffy approaches her.

BUFFY
Uh, hi. Willow, right?
WILLOW
Why? I mean Hi. Did you want me to move?

BUFFY
Why don’t we start with “hi, I’m Buffy.”
(sits by her)
And then let’s segue directly into me asking you for a favor. It doesn’t involve moving, but it
does involve you hanging out with me for a while.

WILLOW
But aren’t you… hanging with Cordelia?

BUFFY
I can’t do both?

WILLOW
Not legally.

BUFFY
Look, I really want to get by here. New school… Cordelia’s been really nice – to me, anyway –
but I have this burning desire not to flunk all my classes, and I heard a rumor that you were the
person to talk to if I wanted to get caught up.

WILLOW
Oh, I could totally help you out! If you have sixth period free we could meet in the library –

BUFFY
–or not. Or, you know, we could meet somewhere quieter. Louder. That place kind of gives me a 
wiggins.

WILLOW
It has that effect on most kids. I love it, though. It’s a great collection, and the new librarian’s
really cool.

BUFFY
He’s new?

WILLOW
Yeah, he just started. He was a curator of some British Museum. Or the British museum, I’m not
sure. But he knows everything and he brought all these historical volumes and biographies and
am I the single dullest person alive?

BUFFY
Not at all!

XANDER
(entering with Jesse)
Hey. Are you guys busy? Can we interrupt? We’re interrupting.

BUFFY
Hey.

JESSE
Hey there.

WILLOW
Buffy, this is Jesse, and that’s Xander.

XANDER
Oh, me and Buffy go way back. Old friends, very close. Then there was that period of
estrangement, I think we were both changing as people, but here we are and it’s like old times,
I’m quite moved.

JESSE
Is it me, or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?

XANDER
(a little embarrassed)
It’s not you.

BUFFY
It’s nice to meeting you guys… I think.

JESSE
Well, we wanted to welcome you, make you feel at home. Unless you have a scary home.

XANDER
And to return this.

He produces the stake.

[ Handwritten to the left side - "She takes it”]

XANDER
The only thing I can figure is that you’re building a really little fence.
BUFFY Oh. No. That was for self defense. Everyone has them in L.A. Pepper spray is so passe.

XANDER
So. What do you like, what do you do for fun, what do you look for in a man… Let’s hear it.

JESSE
If you have any dark, painful secrets that we could publish…

BUFFY
Gee, everybody wants to know about me. How keen.

XANDER
Well, not a lot happens in a one-Starbucks town like Sunnydale. You’re big news.

BUFFY
I’m not. Really.

CORDELIA
Are these people bothering you?

She has appeared behind Jesse, all disdain on her face.

BUFFY
Oh! No.
WILLOW
(covering for her)
She’s not hanging out with us.

JESSE
(smitten)
Hey, Cordelia.

CORDELIA
Oh, please.
(to Buffy)
I don’t want to interrupt your downward mobility. I just thought I’d tell you that you won’t be
meeting Coach Foster, the woman with chest hair, because gym has been canceled due to the
extreme dead guy in the locker.

BUFFY
What?

WILLOW
What are you talking about?

CORDELIA
Some guy was stuffed in Aura’s locker.

BUFFY
Dead.

CORDELIA
Way dead.

XANDER
So not just a little dead then.

CORDELIA
Don’t you have an elsewhere to be?

JESSE
(to Cordelia)
If you need a shoulder to cry on, or just to nibble on –

BUFFY
How did he die?

CORDELIA
I don’t know…

BUFFY
Well, were there any marks?

CORDELIA
Morbid much? I didn’t ask!

BUFFY
Uh, look, I gotta book. I’ll see you guys later.

She takes off, the others watching her.

CORDELIA
What’s her deal?
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKER ROOM – CONTINUOUS

Mr. Flutie closes the door quietly. He turns to see Buffy before him.

MR FLUTIE
Oh! Buffy! Uh, what do you want?
BUFFY
Um, is there a guy in there that’s dead?

MR FLUTIE
Where did you hear that? Okay. Yes. But he’s not a student! Not currently.

BUFFY
Do you know how he died?

MR FLUTIE
What?

BUFFY
I mean – how could this have happened?

MR FLUTIE
Well, that’s for the police to determine when they get here. But this structure is safe, we have inspections,
and I think there’s no grounds for a lawsuit.

BUFFY
Was there a lot of blood? Was there any blood?

MR FLUTIE
I would think you wouldn’t want to involve yourself in this kind of thing.

BUFFY
I don’t. Could I just take a peek?

MR FLUTIE
Unless you already are involved…

BUFFY
Never mind.

MR FLUTIE
(being nicer)
Buffy, I understand this is confusing. You’re probably feeling a lot right now. You should share
those feelings. With someone else.

Buffy smiles wanly, backs off.

CUT TO:
EXT. SIDE OF GYM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy comes around the side of the gym. There is a door to the locker room and she tries it. It’s locked.

She looks around to make sure she’s alone, and then PULLS the door open with a quick tug, splintering the lock. One last look around and she slips inside.

CUT TO:
INT. WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy approaches the body laid out under a blanket.

She hesitates, sure she’s not going to like what she sees. Pulls the blanket from his head and shoulders.

ANGLE: HIS NECK

Has two big ol’ bite marks in it.

What floods onto Buffy’s face is not horror, but grim frustration. She stares down at the body, nearly seething.

BUFFY
Oh, great!
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY – MOMENTS LATER

Buffy strides back in, attitude high.

BUFFY
Okay, what’s the sitch?
She spies Giles and starts up toward him.

GILES 
Sorry?
BUFFY
You heard about the dead guy, right? The dead guy in the locker?

GILES
Yes.

BUFFY
Well, it’s the weirdest thing. He’s got two little holes in his neck and all his blood’s been
drained. Isn’t that bizarre? Aren’t you just going, “Ooooh….”

GILES
I was afraid of this.

BUFFY
Well, I wasn’t! It’s my first day. I was afraid that I’d be behind in all the classes, that I wouldn’t 
make any friends, that I’d have last month’s hair. I didn’t think there would be vampires
on campus. And I don’t care.

GILES
Then why are you here?

She’s stopped for a moment.

BUFFY
To tell you that I don’t care. Which I don’t, and… have now told you. So bye.
She starts out, maybe a little unsatisfied with her exit.

GILES
Will he rise again?
BUFFY
Who?

GILES
The boy.

BUFFY
No, he’s just dead.

GILES
Can you be sure?

BUFFY
To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood and then you have to suck their blood, it’s a
whole big sucking thing. Mostly they’ll just take all your blood and then you just die – why am I
still talking to you?

GILES
You have no idea what’s going on, do you? Do you think it’s coincidence, your coming here?
That boy was just the beginning.

BUFFY
(turning)
Oh, why can’t you leave me alone?

GILES
Because you are the Slayer.

She stops. No comeback just now. He starts down after her, solemnly intoning:

GILES
Into every generation a slayer is born. One girl, in all the world, a Chosen One. One born with the –
She finishes along with him:

BUFFY & GILES
--the strength and skill to hunt the vampires –
BUFFY
The stop the spread of their evil blah blah I’ve heard it, okay?

GILES
I don’t understand this attitude. You’ve accepted your duty, you’ve slain vampires before –

BUFFY
Well, I have both been there and done that. And I am moving on.

GILES
What do you know about this town?

BUFFY
It’s two hours on the freeway from Neiman Marcus.

GILES
Dig a bit in the history of this place and you’ll find there’ve been a steady stream of fairly odd
occurrences. I believe this area is a center of mystical energy. Things gravitate toward it that you
might not find elsewhere.

BUFFY
Like Vampires.

She tries to move past him and he pulls a book off the shelf, hands it to her. It resembles the vampire book he showed her earlier. He continues to pull more off, piling them up in her arms.

GILES
Like werewolves. Zombies. Succubi, incubi… Everything you ever dreaded under your bed and
told yourself couldn’t be by the light of day.
BUFFY
What, did you send away for the Time Life series?

GILES
Uh, yes.

BUFFY
Did you get the free phone?

GILES
The calendar.

BUFFY
Cool.
(remembering her agenda)
Okay, first of all, I’m a vampire slayer. And secondly, I’m retired. Hey, I know! Why don’t you
kill them?

GILES
I’m a watcher. I haven’t the skill.

BUFFY
Oh, come on. Stake through the heart, a little sunlight – it’s like falling off a log.

GILES
The Slayer slays. The Watcher –

BUFFY
Watches?

GILES
Yes. No! He – he – trains her, he prepares her –

BUFFY
Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out of school? Losing all my friends? Having to spend
all my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because it might ‘endanger’
them? Go ahead. Prepare me.

A beat, and she leaves. Giles heads out after her.

ANGLE: IN THE STACKS

A shadowy figure moves about back there, emerges into the light. It’s Xander, excitement, amusement and a disbelief dancing in his face. “Theories in Trig” in his hands.

He tries for a long time to form a word. When he does, it is merely:

XANDER
WHAT?
CUT TO:
INT. HALL – CONTINUOUS

Giles comes out of the library, calls out to Buffy.

GILES
It’s getting worse.
She stops, turns. There are people about, so they are forced to whisper.

BUFFY
What’s getting worse?
GILES
The influx of the undead, the supernatural occurrences. It’s been building for years and now… 
There’s a reason why you’re here, and there’s a reason why it’s now.

BUFFY
Because now is the time my mom moved here.

GILES
Something is coming. Something is going to happen here soon.

BUFFY
Gee, can you vague that up for me…?

GILES
As far as I can tell, the signs point to a crucial mystical upheaval very soon – days, possibly less.

BUFFY
Come on. This is Sunnydale. How bad an evil can there be here?

CUT TO:
INT. DARK PLACE – NIGHT

The camera TRACKS silently through a dark and eerie place. We see candles, broken statuary. A few figures bent in supplication. An ominous CHANTING fills the chamber.

As we move up, we see a single figure kneeling, well ahead of the rest. He is large, powerful, appears to be in his late twenties. In fact, LUKE is much older than that. His dress speaks of many eras, but definitely of none.

The CHANTING increases in intensity as the camera continues to move about the place, passing over Luke and we see what he is kneeling before for the first time.

A pool of blood.

LUKE
The sleeper will awaken.
As he speaks, we see his face clearly. Vampire. Not pretty.

LUKE
The sleeper will awaken. And the world will bleed.
He dips his finger in the blood.

LUKE
Amen.
And now we see:

WIDER ANGLE: THE CHURCH

It’s a bizarre ruin we’re in, buried beneath the ground. The stanchions and arches stand at haphazard angles, sheeted rock pushing in at all sides. The pool of blood is on what would be the altar.

The CHANTING fills the vast room as we

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT TWO
Act Three
INT. BUFFY’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
She is in the agony of outfit choosage, getting ready to go out. She has two, one scanty, the other somewhat plain. She holds them alternatively in front of her, looking in the mirror.

BUFFY
(holding up one)
Hi! I’m an enormous slut!
(the other)
Hi! Would you like a copy of the Watchtower?
(throws them both down)
I used to be so good at this…
Joyce enters, watches her.

JOYCE
Are you going out tonight, honey?
BUFFY
Yeah, Mom. I’m going to a club.

JOYCE
Will there be boys there?

BUFFY
No, Mom; it’s a nun club.

JOYCE
Well, just be careful.

BUFFY
I will.

As the conversation segues into serious territory, both women become somewhat uncomfortable with each other.

JOYCE
I think we can make it work here. I’ve got my positive energy flowing. I’m gonna get the gallery
on its feet – We may already have found a space.
BUFFY
Great.

JOYCE
And that school is a very nurturing environment, which is what you need.

BUFFY
Mom…

JOYCE
Oh, not too nurturing. I know. You’re sixteen, I read all about the dangers of overnurturing.
(honestly)
It’s hard. New town, and all. For me, too. I’m trying to make it work.
(correcting herself)
I’m going to make it work.

BUFFY
I know.

JOYCE
You’re a good girl, Buffy. You just fell in with the wrong crowd. But that’s all behind us now.

BUFFY
It is. From now on, I’m only hanging out with the living. I – I mean, the lively… people.

JOYCE
Okay, have fun.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET – NIGHT

Buffy makes her way on foot to the Bronze. She leaves the suburban area the house is in for the deserted city streets on the edge of town.

She turns a corner, walks down the street, lost in thought – until she HEARS FOOTSTEPS behind her.

She stops, turns slowly.

A figure stands in the dark behind her. Far enough away that she doesn’t feel right saying anything to it. It doesn’t move – she can’t see its face but it seems to be looking at her.

Buffy turns to go.

The figure follows.

CUT TO:
EXT. ANOTHER STREET – A MOMENT LATER

Buffy turns the corner, somewhat worried – moving faster. The figure follows, always at a discreet distance.

CUT TO:
EXT. AN ALLEY – A MOMENT LATER

Buffy turns in. She looks about her. A pipe runs across the narrow alley some ten feet above her. Garbage cans cluster at the other end.

ANGLE: THE FIGURE

Turns into the now-empty alley, starts down it.

Buffy suddenly DROPS down on him, legs locked over his neck. She throws herself back, tipping him over, rolling herself and SLAMMING his body onto the ground.

He’s on his feet quickly, but she grabs him and throws him up against the wall. She closes in, but he makes no move to attack. Puts up his hands.

ANGEL
Is there a problem, ma’am?
He seems faintly amused. Buffy eyes him suspiciously, getting her first good look at him.

ANGEL is strikingly handsome, with intelligence and a kind of distance in his eyes. Moves with a fighter’s grace.

BUFFY
There’s a problem. Why are you following me?
ANGEL
I know what you’re thinking, but don’t worry. I don’t bite.

She backs off a bit, perplexed.

ANGEL
Truth is, I thought you’d be taller. Or bigger, muscles and all that. You’re pretty spry, though.
BUFFY
What do you want?

ANGEL
Same thing you do.

BUFFY
Okay, what do I want?

The amusement leaves his face.

ANGEL
To kill ‘em. To kill ‘em all.
BUFFY
(game show: )
Sorry! That’s incorrect but you do get this lovely watch and a year’s worth of Turtle Wax what I
want… is to be left alone.

ANGEL
You really think that’s an option anymore? You’re standing at the mouth of Hell. And it’s about
to open.

He reaches into his coat for something. It’s a jewelry box. He throws it to her.

ANGEL
Don’t turn your back on this. You’ve got to be ready.
BUFFY
For what?

ANGEL
The Harvest.

He starts out.

BUFFY
Who are you?
ANGEL
Let’s just say I’m a friend.

BUFFY
(exasperated)
Well, maybe I don’t want a friend.

ANGEL
I didn’t say I was yours…

He goes. Buffy watches him go, then opens the box.

ANGLE: IN THE BOX

Is a cross. Small, antique, on a gold chain, [Handwritten to the side: “Silver”, ‘gold chain’ is circled]

WIDER ANGLE: BUFFY ALONE IN THE ALLEY

Buffy looks at the cross, at the departing figure of the mysterious man.

And as she walks slowly away, the camera TRACKS past the corner, past another group of garbage cans.

In front of them, right before us but unseen by Buffy, are two figures. The poor man we saw in her dream, and a vampire. The beast has its face burrowing in his neck, as the last of his life shudders out.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE BRONZE – NIGHT

A decent crowd mills aimlessly around the joint, high school students and older. The place has an appealingly dive-y earthiness; no waiting in line for the bouncer to decide whether you’re cool or not. Those that are in line wait only to pay the four bucks to get their hands stamped if they’re old enough to drink.

Buffy moves her way up the line, scanning about for a familiar face. She doesn’t find one. As she is let in we FOLLOW HER INTO:

INT. THE BRONZE – CONTINUOUS

It’s dark, crowded and noisy. A fairly thrashsome band holds forth on stage, blasting the kind of music that would cause major moshing in a rowdier crowd. Coffee bar in the back, and a balcony above with tables for two.

Buffy makes her way through, still looking about. A good looking GUY spies her and waves, smiling.

Buffy smiles vaguely, waving back. A moment before she realizes he’s waving to a guy right behind her. She attempts to turn her wave into fixing her hair, looking embarrassed.

ANGLE: WILLOW

Is getting a soda at the bar. She turns back to look at the band just as Buffy comes up to her.

BUFFY
Hi!
WILLOW
Oh, hi! Hi.

BUFFY
Are you here with someone?

WILLOW
No, I’m just here. I thought Xander was gonna show up…

BUFFY
Oh, are you guys going out?

WILLOW
No. We’re just friends. We used to go out, but we broke up.

BUFFY
How come?

WILLOW
He stole my barbie.
(off Buffy’s look)
We were five.

BUFFY
Oh.

WILLOW
I don’t actually date a whole lot… lately.

BUFFY
Why not?

WILLOW
Well, when I’m with a boy I like, it’s hard for me to say anything cool, or witty, or at all… I can
usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.

BUFFY
(laughing)
It’s not that bad. 
It is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.

BUFFY
You really haven’t been dating lately.

WILLOW
It’s probably easy for you.

BUFFY
(a little forlornly)
Oh, yeah. Real easy.

WILLOW
I mean, you don’t seem too shy.

BUFFY
Well, my philosophy is – do you wanna hear my philosophy?

WILLOW
I do.

BUFFY
Life is short.

WILLOW
Life is short.

BUFFY
Not original, I’ll grant you. But it’s true. Why waste time being all shy? Why worry about some
guy and if he’s gonna laugh at you? You know? Seize the moment. ‘Cause tomorrow you might
be dead.

WILLOW
Oh… That’s nice…

Buffy sees somebody moving about on the balcony. Her brow furrows.

BUFFY
Uh, I’ll be back in a minute.
WILLOW
That’s okay. You don’t have to come back.

BUFFY
(smiling at her self-effacing attitude)
I’ll be back in a minute.

She takes off, leaving Willow at the bar.

WILLOW
(to herself)
Seize the moment…
ANGLE: ATOP THE BALCONY

Buffy comes up, makes her way to the railing overlooking the stage. She leans on it, and we see that Giles is standing beside her. He doesn’t even look at her.

BUFFY
So, you like to party with the students? Isn’t that kind of skanky?
GILES
(witheringly)
Right. This is me having fun.
(looking out on stage)
Watching clown-hair prance about is hardly my idea of a party. I’d much prefer to be home with a cup of bovril and a good book.

BUFFY
STAT.

GILES
This is a perfect breeding ground for Vampire activity. Dark, crowded… Besides, I knew you
were likely to show up. And I have to make you understand –

BUFFY
That the Harvest is coming, I know, your friend told me.

GILES
(thrown)
What did you say?

BUFFY
The… Harvest. That means something to you? ‘Cause I’m drawing a blank.

GILES
I’m not sure… Who told you this?

BUFFY
This guy. Dark, gorgeous in an annoying sort of way. I figured you were buds.

GILES
No… The Harvest… Did he say anything else?

BUFFY
Something about the mouth of Hell. I really didn’t like him.

They both look down at the floor for a moment, at the dancing kids.

GILES
Look at them. Throwing themselves about…. Completely unaware of the danger that surrounds
them.
BUFFY
Lucky them…

GILES
Or perhaps you’re right. Perhaps there is no trouble coming. The signs could be wrong. It’s not as
though you’re having the nightmares…

And we MOVE IN on Buffy’s face, clouding over. She says nothing, just looks down at the dancing kids.

ANGLE: THE FLOOR

Kids writhe about to the music with healthy abandon.

We find Cordelia off to the side, watching with her friends.

CORDELIA
My mom doesn’t even get out of bed anymore. The doctor says it’s Epstein Barr, I’m like,
“please, it’s chronic hepatitis or at least Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.” I mean nobody cool has
Epstein Barr anymore.
Jesse approaches her, smiling.

JESSE
Cordelia!
CORDELIA
Oh, yay, it’s my stalker.

JESSE
Hey, you look great.

CORDELIA
Well, I’m glad we had this chat –

JESSE
Listen, I, um, do you wanna dance?

CORDELIA
(witheringly)
With you?

JESSE
Well, uh, yeah.

CORDELIA
Well, uh, no.

She takes off, posse in tow. Jesse just soaks up the pain.

JESSE
Fine. Plenty of other fish in the sea. Oh yeah. I’m on the prowl. Witness me prowling.
He looks around at the throng, officially beginning his prowl.

ANGLE: BUFFY AND GILES

In mid-conversation. Shaken by the dreams thing, Buffy is giving ground.

BUFFY
I didn’t say I’d never slay another vampire. I’m just not gonna get way extracurricular with it. If I
run into one, sure…
GILES
But will you be ready? There’s so much you don’t know, about them and about your own
powers. A vampire appears to be a normal person, until the feed is upon them. Only then do they
reveal their true demonic visage.

BUFFY
You’re like a textbook with arms! I know this!

GILES
The point is, a Slayer should be able to see them anyway. Without looking, without thinking. Can
you tell me if there’s a vampire in this building?

BUFFY
Maybe?

GILES
You should know! Even through this mass and this din you should be able to sense them. Try.
Reach out with your mind.

She looks down at the mass of kids on the floor. Furrows her brow.

GILES
You have to hone your senses, focus until the energy washes over you, till you can feel every
particle of –
BUFFY
There’s one.

Giles stops, nonplused.

GILES
What? Where?
BUFFY
(pointing)
Down there. Talking to that girl.

ANGLE: THEIR POV

In the corner stands a good looking young man, talking to a girl we can’t really see.

GILES
But you don’t know –
BUFFY
Oh, please. Look at his jacket. He’s got the sleeves rolled up. And the shirt… Deal with that
outfit for a moment.

GILES
It’s dated?

BUFFY
It’s carbon dated! Trust me: only someone who’s been living underground for ten years would
think that was the look.

GILES
But… you didn’t hone…

BUFFY
(noticing something)
Oh, no…

ANGLE: THE VAMPIRE

Is still chatting with the girl. He motions for her to come with him, and she comes into view.

It’s Willow.

GILES
Isn’t that –
BUFFY
Willow.

GILES
What is she doing?

BUFFY
Seizing the moment.

She starts toward the stairs.

ANGLE: WILLOW AND THE VAMPIRE BOY

Head out the back door by the stage.

Buffy fights her way down the stairs. She looks toward where they were and sees they’re gone. She looks about a moment, and then, guessing correctly, heads for the backstage door as well.

But it’s a struggle: the closer she gets to the stage, the more crowded it gets. She finally pushes to the door.

CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE – CONTINUOUS

It’s dark here, and somewhat labryinthian. Buffy moves slowly, cautiously. There is no one about.

She finds an old chair, snaps the leg off, a makeshift stake.

There is no one about. Buffy heads for the exit door. Sticks her head out it but there’s no one in the alley either.

Slowly, perturbed, she starts back for the main door.

She turns the corner and he’s ON HER! She grabs him, throws him up against the wall, holding him two feet off the ground –

Well, holding her, actually. Holding Cordelia, who has the same dumbfounded gape that the other girls coming out of the bathroom have.

BUFFY
Cordelia!
CORDELIA
Excuse me… could you be any weirder? Is there a more weirdness that you could have?

Buffy lets her down, lowering the stake.

CORDELIA
God, what is your childhood trauma?
BUFFY
(trying to be chipper)
Did you guys see Willow? Did she come by here?

CORDELIA
Why? Did you need to attack her with a stick?

Buffy gives up. Face red, she retreats back the way she came.

Cordy and the others are still agape. After a moment, Cordy regains her composure.

CORDELIA
Excuse me. I have to call everyone that I’ve ever met right now.
CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE – CONTINUOUS

Buffy comes back out, finds Giles at the bottom of the stairs. She looks around as he says:

GILES
Is he dead? 
That was fast. Well done. I’d best go to the library. This “Harvest” is –
BUFFY
I didn’t find them.

GILES
The vampire’s not dead?

BUFFY
No, but my social life is on the critical list.

GILES
What do we do?

BUFFY
You go on. I’ll take care of it.

GILES
I should come with you, no?

BUFFY
(heading out)
Don’t worry. One vampire I can handle.

As she exits, she brushes past Jesse. The camera STAYS on him, as we see he is chatting up a girl.

JESSE
What did you say your name was?
And the camera comes around to show the girl he’s talking to: it’s the vampire from the opening. Needless to say, she has her normal face on. And she’ll be known from now on as:

DARLA
Darla.
JESSE
Darla. I haven’t seen you before. 
Are you from around here?

DARLA
No, but I’ve got family here.

JESSE
Have I met them?

DARLA
You probably will.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH – CONTINOUS

The CHANTING we heard earlier continues, peaking in intensity. By the altar, Luke suddenly looks up.

He starts moving slowly back, eyes wide with religious fervor. All the figures in the church start moving back, almost as one.

ANGLE: THE POOL OF BLOOD

We are low, right above the surface, as Luke prays before it. Suddenly a HEAD shoots up from in the blood. Luke starts, looks at it. He moves back, away from the pool.

Something breaks the surface of the liquid. Something rises.

It is THE MASTER, the most powerful of vampires. Born Heinrich Joseph Nest (some six hundred years ago,) he wears a vaguely SS-like outfit.

What he does not wear is anything resembling a human face. He is as much demon as man. As powerful as Luke is, it’s clear that this man is much more so, both from his bearing and from the reverence with which Luke looks upon him.

LUKE
Master…
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT THREE
Act Four
INT. THE CHURCH – MOMENTS LATER
The Master steps forward, his face still in relative darkness. Luke steps back reverentially. The Master looks about him for a moment.

THE MASTER
Luke.
LUKE
Master…

THE MASTER
I am weak.

LUKE
Come the Harvest, you’ll be restored.

THE MASTER
The Harvest…

LUKE
We’re almost there. Soon you’ll be free.

The Master takes another step forward, past Luke. He reaches his hand out slowly. As he does, the air in front of him starts to ripple slightly – a kind of mystical wall. He pulls his hand back.

THE MASTER
I must be ready. I need my strength.
LUKE
I’ve sent your servants to bring you some food.

THE MASTER
Good.

Luke starts out.

THE MASTER 
Luke…
LUKE
(stopping)
Yes?

THE MASTER
Bring me something… young.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET BY WOODED GLADE – NIGHT

Willow and the Vampire Boy walk along, alone in the dark. She is clearly nervous, though not for the reason she should be.

WILLOW
Sure is dark…
VAMPIRE BOY
It’s night.

WILLOW
That’s a dark time. Night. Traditionally.

They walk a bit more.

WILLOW
I still can’t believe I’ve never seen you at school. Do you have Mr. Chomsky for History.
He doesn’t answer. Stops.

WILLOW
The ice cream bar’s down this way – it’s past Hamilton street.
He takes her hand.

VAMPIRE BOY
I know a shortcut.
He leads her into the dark of wood.

CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRONZE – NIGHT

Buffy comes from around the back, looking around. Xander comes up to her, carrying his skateboard.

XANDER
You’re leaving already?
BUFFY
Xander, have you seen Willow?

XANDER
Not tonight.

BUFFY
I need to find her. She left with a guy.

XANDER
We are talking about Willow, right?
(impressed)
Scoring at the Bronze. Work it, girlfriend.

BUFFY
(looking around)
Where would they go?

XANDER
Why, you know something about Mr. Goodbar that she doesn’t? Oh! Hey. I hope he’s not a
vampire. ‘Cause then you’d have to slay him.

She turns back to him, surprised and miffed.

BUFFY
Was there a school bulletin? Was it in the news? Is there anybody in this town who doesn’t
know I’m a slayer?
XANDER
I only know that you think you’re a slayer, and I only know that ‘cause I was in the library today.

BUFFY
Whatever. Just tell me where Willow would go.

XANDER
You’re serious.

BUFFY
We don’t find her, there’s gonna be another dead body in the morning.

A beat, as he looks at her. Sees she isn’t kidding. Isn’t wrong.

XANDER
Come on.
As they head off.

CUT TO:
EXT. GRAVEYARD – CONTINUOUS

Willow is still walking with Vampire Boy, but getting increasingly creeped out.

WILLOW
Okay, this is nice and… scary… 
Are you sure this is faster?
He says nothing. She keeps walking beside him, uncertain.

He stops at a small mausoleum. The entrance is a well of black.

VAMPIRE BOY
Hey. You ever been in one of these?
WILLOW
No thank you.

He moves in close, holding her intimately.

VAMPIRE BOY
Come on. What are you afraid of?
He pushes her into the blackness of the entrance.

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Willow stumbles in. She looks about her frightenedly, adjusting to the increased dark.

The place is small, with carved stone walls. A large tomb takes up much of the middle, the stone figure of a man lying atop it. Behind her is the doorway she came in, ahead, a much smaller, iron door, locked shut.

She spins all the way round to see the boy filling the entrance.

WILLOW
That wasn’t funny.
No response. He steps closer, his face in shadow. She circles away from him, moving closer to the doorway.

WILLOW
I think I’m gonna go.
VAMPIRE BOY
Is that what you think?

All the playfulness has drained out of his voice. She takes a step back, another, turns and moves WHAM – right into DARLA.

Emitting something between a scream and a squeak, Willow steps back. Darla looks at her, at the boy.

DARLA
(to him; re: her)
Is this the best you could do?
VAMPIRE BOY
She’s fresh.

DARLA
Hardly enough to share.

VAMPIRE BOY
Why didn’t you bring your own?

DARLA
I did.

She indicates the doorway behind her, as Jesse stumbles dazed from the darkness.

JESSE
Hey, wait up…
WILLOW
Jesse!

She goes over to him, relieved. He is clutching his neck.

JESSE
(to Darla)
I think you gave me a hickey…
He takes his hand away. There is blood on it, on his neck. Willow looks over at the other two, eyes wide.

DARLA
(off the boy’s look)
I got hungry on the way.
WILLOW
Jesse, let’s get out of here.

DARLA
You’re not going anywhere.

WILLOW
Leave us alone.

DARLA
(in Willow’s face)
You’re not going anywhere until we’ve FED!

And on the last word she brings her face right up to Willow’s and it CHANGES, snaps right before our eyes into the grotesque demon-face we saw before.

Willow SCREAMS, takes a stumbled step back and falls.

The boy laughs, circling, and we see that he has changed as well.

BUFFY
Well, this is nice.
She steps in, Xander following her. Everybody stops.

BUFFY
A little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows – call it home.
DARLA
Who the hell are you?

BUFFY
Wow, you mean there’s actually somebody around here who doesn’t know already? That’s a
relief. I’m telling you, having a secret identity in this town is a job of work.

He is moving between the two Vampires, who loosen their grip on their respective victims.

XANDER
Buffy, we bail now, right?
VAMPIRE BOY
Not yet.

BUFFY
Okay, first of all, what’s with this outfit? Live in the now, okay? You look like DeBarge.
(turning to Darla)
Now, we can do this the hard way, or… well, actually, there’s just the hard way.

DARLA
Fine with me.

BUFFY
You sure? It’s not gonna be pretty. We’re talking violence, strong language, adult content.

As she speaks, the Boy Vampire RUSHES her from behind, charging at her with incredible speed and momentum –

Buffy whips a stake out from her jacket and in one graceful motion sticks it out behind her, letting the boy impale himself on it. He stops, eyes wide, and falls back.

Buffy never even faces him.

ANGLE: THE BOY VAMPIRE

As he hits the ground, his body crumbles to dust.

BUFFY
(to Darla)
See what happens when you roughhouse?
Xander and Willow are speechless, staring at the ground where a body used to be.

Darla is wide eyed, exceedingly wary. But not cowed. She moves slowly around, preparing to fight herself.

DARLA
He was young. And stupid.
BUFFY
Xander, go.

DARLA
Don’t go far.

She lunges at Buffy, who parries her blows with martial arts precision.

Xander herds the others out.

CUT TO:
EXT. GRAVEYARD – CONTINUOUS

The three kids run out of the mausoleum, Willow and Xander supporting Jesse. All three are totally freaked – Jesse the least so, since he’s still weak and dazed.

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Darla hit the ground with a painful thud.

Buffy stands over her. She’s a bit out of breath, and the humor is gone from her visage.

BUFFY
You know, I just wanted to start over. Be like everybody else. Have some friends, maybe a dog…
But no. You had to come here. You couldn’t go suck on some other town.
DARLA
Who are you?

BUFFY
Don’t you know?

HANDS suddenly grab Buffy by the throat, lift her bodily from the ground.

LUKE
I don’t care.
He steps out of the shadows from behind her – his bulk dwarfing her – and throws her a good fifteen feet. She hits the wall face first, landing badly.

Luke turns on Darla, who is getting up.

LUKE
You were supposed to be bringing an offering for the Master. We’re almost at Harvest and you
dally with this child?
DARLA
We had someone. But she came and… she killed Thomas… Luke, she’s strong.

LUKE
(contemptuously)
You go. I’ll see if I can handle the little girl.

ANGLE: BUFFY

She lifts herself off the floor just as Luke suddenly closes on her, grabs her. She’s ready this time, though, and she knocks his arms away, kicks him in the face. It sends him back a bit but he recovers in a second, landing a solid punch to her jaw.

LUKE
You are strong.
He slams her back to the ground.

LUKE
I’m stronger.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE FOREST – CONTINUOUS

The three kids are making pretty good time, despite having to support Jesse.

WILLOW
We’ll get the police – it’s just a few blocks up –
They stop. They stare, despair creeping onto their faces.

Three Vampires stand waiting for them.

CUT TO:
INT. THE MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy looks like she’s been kicked around a bit. She circles around the tomb, keeping it between her and Luke.

LUKE
You’re wasting my time.
BUFFY
Hey, I had other plans, too, okay?

He SHOVES the top of the tomb with all his might, sends it flying at her.

She LEAPS over it – jumps up onto the tomb, leaps off it, flipping, and WHAM – plants both feet solidly in Luke’s chest.

He falls back, as does she – she gets up first and pulls out her stake, dries it toward his chest – but he grabs just before it reaches.

LUKE
You think you can stop me? Stop us?
He squeezes – and the stake splinters in his powerful grip. He PUNCHES Buffy, knocks her back.

LUKE
You have no idea what you’re dealing with.
He stands, triumphant, over her. Begins intoning the sacred text:

LUKE
And like a plague of boils, the race of Man covered the earth. But on the third day of the newest
light will come over the Harvest…
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY – CONTINUOUS

Giles has his ancient texts out, is studying them in growing consternation.

LUKE (V.O.)
… when the blood of men will flow as wine…
ANGLE: GILES’ BOOK

Shows a Dore-like engraving: a massacre. People writhing, blood everywhere – in the center of them all, a Demon with a three-pointed star on his forehead, feeding off a woman.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH – CONTINUOUS

We TRACK IN on the Master sitting, his face in darkness.

LUKE (V.O.)
… when the Master will walk among them once more…
CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST – CONTINUOUS

Xander, Willow and Jesse back away from the vampires –

LUKE (V.O.)
… the world will belong to the Old Ones…
--to find Darla right behind them!

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy is getting up, keeping her eyes on Luke –

…and Hell itself will come to town.

She tries to move to the side, to get away – he backhands Buffy with all the force he has. She flies back – right into the tomb!

ANGLE: IN THE TOMB

Buffy falls and lands HARD on her back, the wind knocked out of her. She looks beside her – and sees the withered corpse of the tomb’s owner.

She’s hurt pretty bad. She looks up but no Luke. Only the walls of the tomb. He could be anywhere.

Slowly, achingly slowly, she lifts her head. Truly scared. Looks over one side of the tomb – nothing. Looks over the other.

Luke FILLS THE FRAME, roaring, jumping into the crypt on top of her.

She tries to fight him off but she’s well pinned. He contemplates her a moment with gleeful animal hunger. Teeth dripping. [Hand written: “Not”].

LUKE
Amen.
He bears down.

BLACK OUT.
TO BE CONTINUED

FADE IN:

INT. MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT

LUKE bears down on BUFFY, fangs bared. She struggles, but he's got her pinned. He rips open her shirt a bit to get at her throat. Grabs her - and SCREAMS.

He jumps back, SMOKE curling out of his hand.

ANGLE: BUFFY'S NECK

The cross Angel gave her has slipped out of an inside pocket.

Buffy takes the moment and KICKS with both legs, sends Luke flying back out of the tomb. She jumps up herself and before he can recover, she RUNS out of there.

CUT TO:
EXT. GRAVEYARD - CONTINUOUS

As fast as she can -- stumbling a bit and breathing hard from the beating she took -- Buffy books through the graveyard. As she reaches the trees on the edge of it, she looks back at the Mausoleum.

Nobody's coming.

She hears WILLOW SCREAM.

WILLOW
No! Nooo! Get -- off --
Buffy runs to the sound of the voice -- comes to find:

ANGLE: WILLOW

on the ground, struggling with a vampire.

The vampire has Willow pinned, is going in for the neck -- then he looks up, hearing something.

Buffy's foot whips into his face, sending him flying way back.

He lands hard on his back and scrambles away, holding his nose.

Buffy is all business now, looking around her in quiet fury. Her senses alert.

She hears a CRACK, some SCUFFING on the ground. Takes off, leaving Willow wide-eyed and freaked. After a moment, she rises and follows.

ANGLE: XANDER

is unconscious, being dragged away by two other vampires. They hear something behind them, turn slowly around.

It's Willow, stumbling out from behind a tree. She looks extremely unthreatening.

They turn back and Buffy is right in front of them. She takes them both out with one punch. They fly back, then scramble to their feet.

Buffy grabs a branch, snaps it off the tree. She comes at them with this makeshift stake -- nails one in the chest.

The other flees.

Willow runs up to XANDER, cradles his head. He is just coming to.

WILLOW
Xander, are you okay?
XANDER
Man... something hit me...

Buffy is still looking around, unsatisfied.

BUFFY
Where's Jesse?
WILLOW
I don't know -- they surrounded us -- he was really weak...

XANDER
That girl grabbed him. Took off.

BUFFY
Which way?

XANDER
I don't know.

Buffy looks into the night. The camera CIRCLES her as she looks around. There is nothing to see.

BUFFY
(quietly)
Jesse...
BLACK OUT.
END OF TEASER
Act One
INT. THE LIBRARY - MORNING
We open on a Globe. As we hear GILES begin to SPEAK, we PAN over to Xander and Willow, sitting in the middle of the library. Neither of them appears to have slept since last night.

GILES (O.S.)
This world is older than any of you know, and
contrary to popular mythology, it did not begin
as a paradise. For untold eons, Demons walked the
earth; made it their home... their Hell.
Still we PAN, to find Giles on the upper level, standing at the railing. His expression is as grave as theirs.

GILES
In time they lost their purchase on this reality,
and the way was made for the mortal animals. For
Man. What remains of the Old Ones are vestiges:
Certain magicks, certain creatures...
BUFFY
And vampires...

She emerges from Giles' office, wrapping a bandage around her forearm. Xander rises, agitated.

XANDER
Okay, this is where I have a problem, see,
because we're now talking about vampires. We're
having a talk with vampires in it.
WILLOW
Oooh... I need to sit down.

BUFFY
You are sitting down.

WILLOW
Oh. Good for me.

XANDER
So vampires are demons?

GILES
The books tell that the last Demon to leave this
reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He
was a human form possessed -- infected -- by the
Demon's soul. He bit another, and another... and
so they walk the earth, feeding. Killing some,
mixing their blood with others to make more of
their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out,
and the Old Ones to return.

CUT TO:
INT. A TUNNEL - MORNING

Not that you could see whether it was morning or night in this place -- it remains as dark and humid as the earth that swallowed it.

JESSE is being dragged through the tunnel by Luke, DARLA, by his side. Jesse is still staggering into consciousness, and the more he awakens, the less he likes it.

He looks about in fear at the two inhuman faces, at the end of the tunnel they are dragging him through. It seems to be an old cracked pipe, and it ends at:

INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

Coming out of the pipe, the threesome makes its way down a pile of rocks to the floor of the wrecked church.

Jesse looks about, wonder tingeing the edges of his fear. He is stood before the altar, before the pool of blood.

From the darkness, something moves. Emerges.

THE MASTER regards his servants, his total authority obvious to all. He looks at Jesse.

THE MASTER
Is this for me?
LUKE
An offering, Master.

DARLA
He's a good one. His blood is pure.

THE MASTER
(quietly -- almost innocuously)
You've tasted it.

Darla starts back a step, afraid.

THE MASTER
(smiling)
I'm your faithful dog. You bring me scraps.
DARLA
I didn't mean to --

THE MASTER I've waited. For three score years I have waited.
While you come and go I have been stuck here,
(voice rising)
here, in a house of worship. My ascension is
almost at hand. Pray that when it comes... I'm in
a better mood.

DARLA
Master, forgive me. We had more offerings but
there was trouble. A girl.

LUKE
There was a girl. She fought well, and she knew 
of our breed. It's possible that she may be...

The Master turns to him.

THE MASTER
A Slayer?
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

XANDER
And that would be a what?
GILES
As long as there have been vampires, there has
been the Slayer. One girl in all the world --

BUFFY
He loves doing this part.

GILES
(speeding up)
All right: They hunt vampires, one Slayer dies,
the next is called, Buffy is the Slayer, don't
tell anyone. I think that's all the vampire 
information you need.

XANDER
Except for one thing. How do you kill them?

BUFFY
You don't. I do.

XANDER
Well, Jesse --

BUFFY
Jesse's my responsibility. I let him get taken.

XANDER
That's not true.

WILLOW
If you hadn't showed up, they would have... taken
us too... Does anybody mind if I pass out.

BUFFY
Breathe...

WILLOW
Breathe.

BUFFY
Breathe.
(to Giles)
This big guy, Luke, he talked about an offering
to the Master. I don't know who or what, but if
they weren't just feeding, Jesse may still be
alive. I'm gonna find him.

WILLOW
This is probably the dumb question, but shouldn't
we call the police?

GILES
Do you think they'd believe us?

WILLOW
We don't have to say vampires. We could say there
was... a bad man.

BUFFY
They couldn't handle it if they did come. They'd
only show up with guns.

GILES
(to Buffy)
You've no idea where they took Jesse?

BUFFY
I looked around, but... soon as they got clear of
the woods they could have just
(indicating flight)
--whoom.

XANDER
They can fly?

BUFFY
They can drive.

XANDER
Oh.

WILLOW
I don't remember hearing a car...

GILES
Well, let's take an enormous intuitive leap and
say they went underground.

BUFFY
Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get
anywhere in town without catching any rays. I
didn't see any access around there, though.

XANDER
Well, there's electrical tunnels. They run under
the whole town.

GILES
If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system, it
might indicate a meeting place. I suppose we
could go to the building commission --

BUFFY
We so don't have time.

WILLOW
Uh, guys? There may be another way.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

THE MASTER
A Slayer... Have you any proof?
LUKE
Only that she fought me and yet lives.

THE MASTER
Very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the
last time that happened.

LUKE
1843, in Madrid. And the bastard caught me
sleeping.

THE MASTER
She mustn't be allowed to interfere with the
Harvest.

LUKE
I would never let that happen.

THE MASTER
You needn't worry. I believe she'll come to us.
We have something that she wants. If she is a
Slayer, and this boy lives, she'll try to save
him.

Luke goes up to Jesse, smiling.

LUKE
I thought you nothing more than a meal, boy.
Congratulations. You've just been upgraded to
"bait".

On a computer screen.

BUFFY (O.S.)
There it is.
WIDE ANGLE:

Willow sits at the computer, everyone else gathered around her.

WILLOW
This runs under the graveyard.
XANDER
I don't see any access.

GILES
So all the city plans are just open to the
public?

WILLOW
Uh, well, in a way. I sort of stumbled onto them
when I accidentally... decrypted the city
council's security system.

XANDER
(still focused on the screen)
Someone's been naughty...

BUFFY
There's nothing here. This is useless!

GILES
I think you should ease up on yourself.

BUFFY 
You're the one who told me I wasn't prepared
enough. Understatement. I thought I was on top of
it, and then that Monster Luke came out of
nowhere --

She stops. Pauses.

XANDER
What?
BUFFY
(working it out)
He didn't come out of nowhere. He came from
behind me. I was facing the entrance. He came
from behind me and he didn't follow me out.
(looks at them)
The access to the tunnels is in the mausoleum.

GILES
Are you sure?

BUFFY
The girl must have doubled back with Jesse after
I got out. God, I'm so mentally challenged!

XANDER
So, what's the plan? We saddle up, right?

BUFFY
There's no 'we'. Okay? I'm the Slayer, and you're
not.

XANDER
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face.

BUFFY
Xander, this is deeply dangerous.

XANDER
I'm inadequate. That's fine. I'm less than a man.

WILLOW
Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place
full of monsters, but I do want to help. I need
to.

GILES
Then help me. I've been researching this Harvest
affair. Seems to be some sort of pre-ordained
massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell on earth... Quite 
charmless. I am fuzzy on the details, however,
and it may be that you can wrest some information
from that dread machine.
(off their uncomprehending looks)
That was a bit British, wasn't it?

BUFFY
Welcome to the new world.

GILES
(translates to Willow)
I want you to go on the Net.

WILLOW
Oh! Yeah. Sure. I can do that.

BUFFY
Then I'm out of here.
(to Xander and Willow)
If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.

GILES
Do I have to tell you to be careful?

Buffy looks at him a moment. Then she's out.

CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

Buffy heads toward a gate that stands open. She is about to go through it when FLUTIE appears right behind her.

MR. FLUTIE
And where do we think we're going?
BUFFY
We? I? Me?

MR. FLUTIE We're not leaving school grounds, are we?

BUFFY
No! I'm just ... admiring the fence. This is
quality fencework.

MR. FLUTIE
Because if we were leaving school grounds on our
second day at a new school after being kicked out
of our old school for delinquent behavior -- do
you see where I'm going with this?

BUFFY
(it comes to her:)
Mr. Giles!

MR. FLUTIE
What?

BUFFY
He asked me to get a book for him. From the store
'cause I have a free period and I'm a big reader
did it mention that on my transcripts?

MR. FLUTIE
Mr. Giles.

BUFFY
Ask him.

Mr. Flutie shuts and locks the gate, saying:

MR. FLUTIE
Well, maybe that's how they do things in Britain,
they've got that royal family and all kinds of
problems. But here at Sunnydale nobody leaves 
campus while school's in session. Are we clear?
BUFFY
We're clear.

MR. FLUTIE
That's the Buffy Summers I want in my school. The
sensible girl, with her feet on the ground.

He smiles, leaves.

ANGLE: BUFFY'S FEET

Standing before the fence. After a bit they jump up, leave the frame. A moment later we see her land on the other side, take off running.

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM - CONTINUOUS

But for the light from the doorway, it's just as dark in here as it was last night. Buffy makes her way cautiously, looking about her. She senses a lurking presence, but the shadows give up nothing.

She reaches the iron door on the other side. Tires it. It's locked. She stops, letting out a long breath.

BUFFY
(not looking around)
I don't suppose you've got a key on you?
ANGEL steps from the shadows, a smile in his eyes.

ANGEL
They really don't like me dropping in.
BUFFY
Why not?

ANGEL
They really don't like me.

BUFFY
(sarcastically)
How could that possibly be?

ANGEL
I knew you'd figure out this entryway sooner
or later. Actually, I thought it was gonna be a
little sooner.

BUFFY
I'm sorry you had to wait. Look, if you're gonna
be popping up with this cryptic wise man act on a
regular basis, can you at least tell me your 
name?

ANGEL
Angel.

BUFFY
Angel.
(offhand)
It's a pretty name.

ANGEL
Don't go down there.

BUFFY
Deal with my going.

ANGEL
You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk.
Tonight is the Harvest. Unless you can prevent it,
the Master walks.

BUFFY
If this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why
don't you stop it?

ANGEL
Because I'm afraid.

The unashamed openness of the statement catches her a bit off guard. She looks at him a moment.

She KICKS the door open.

ANGEL
They'll be expecting you.
BUFFY
I've got a friend down there -- or, a potential
friend.
(joking)
Do you know what it's like to have a friend?

He doesn't answer.

BUFFY
(gently)
That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.

ANGEL
When you hit the tunnels, head east, toward the
school. That's where you're likely to find them.

BUFFY
You gonna wish me luck?

He says nothing. She looks at him a moment more, then heads into the darkness.

He stands there, not moving. Quiet concern on his face.

ANGEL
(softly)
Good luck.
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT ONE
Act Two
INT. TUNNELS - DAY

They are dark, forbidding, and they run in all directions.

Buffy climbs down a ladder, drops into them. She looks about her, taking it in.

ANGLE: A RAT

Scurries by her foot.

Buffy doesn't flinch. She starts down a tunnel, moving slowly. The dark enveloping her.

She turns a corner, slowly. Nothing. Starts down it.

She hears something and spins, sneaks up and looks down another tunnel.

ANGLE: DOWN THE OTHER TUNNEL

Shadows. Noise. Nothing solid.

She pulls her head back and he's right behind her!

XANDER
Did you see anything?
BUFFY
Xander! What are you doing here?

XANDER
Something stupid. I followed you. I couldn't just
sit around not doing anything.

BUFFY
I understand. Now go away.

XANDER
Jesse's my bud, okay? If I can help him, then
that's what I gotta do.

A beat, as she accepts this.

XANDER
Besides, it's this or Chem class.
They make their way through the dark.

CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

Giles has his arcane volumes out, is consulting them. After some digging, he finds something interesting. He looks closely at one passage, translating to himself from the Latin.

GILES
"For they will gather, and be gathered. All that
is theirs shall be his... From the Vessel pours
life." Pours life...
ANGLE: AN ENGRAVING

A bestial fellow holds his hand out, commanding a throng of villagers, all of whom are bleeding. Below, in what might be Hell, a demon glows with power.

Upon the bestial one's forehead, a crude symbol has been drawn, a star with three points.

He looks over at another passage.

GILES
(reads)
"On the night of the crescent moon, the first
past the solstice, it will come." Of course.
(he looks up)
Tonight.
CUT TO:
INT. COMPUTER CLASS - DAY

Everyone is working, alone and in groups, devising programs. CORDELIA and HARMONY struggle mightily with theirs.

CORDELIA
No! It's suppose to find the syntax and match it.
Or, wait...
HARMONY
(typing slowly)
Are we going to the Bronze tonight?

CORDELIA
No, we're going to the other cool place in
Sunnydale.

Harmony looks at her inquisitively.

CORDELIA
Of course we're going to the Bronze! Friday
night, no cover. But you should have been there
last night.
HARMONY
(re: program)
I think we did this part wrong.

CORDELIA
Why do we have to devise these programs? Isn't
that what nerds are for?
(quietly)
What did she do?

Harmony cranes over to look at:

ANGLE: WILLOW

Sitting next to them, but in her own world. She is bringing things up on the Net, typing intently, scrolling, searching...

HARMONY
Uh, she's doing something else.
CUT TO:

INT. TUNNELS - LATER

Buffy and Xander turn a corner, ready for anything.

Nothing. They keep walking, alert. Xander picks up the conversation they were in:

XANDER
Okay, so: crosses, garlic, stake through the
heart.
BUFFY
That'll get it done.

XANDER
Cool. Of course, I don't actually have any of
those things.

BUFFY
(hands him a cross)
Good thinking.

XANDER
Well, the part of my brain that would tell me to
bring that stuff is still busy telling me not to
come down here. I brought this, though.

He produces a flashlight, turns it on.

BUFFY
Turn that off!
XANDER
(he does)
Okay, okay. So, what else?

BUFFY
What else what?

XANDER
For Vampire Slayage.

?

XANDER
(a little weakly)
So you've done some beheading in your time.

BUFFY
Oh, yeah. There was this one time, I was pinned
down by this vampire, he played left tackle for
the varsity -- I mean, before he was... well
anyway he's got one of those really thick necks
and all I've got is a little Exacto knife --
(off Xander's gape)
You're not loving this story.

XANDER
Actually, I find it oddly comforting.

CUT TO:
INT. COMPUTER CLASS - DAY

Willow is busily bringing up relevant data from the Net, her brow furrowed in concentration. At the next terminal, Cordelia is struggling with a program while holding court.

CORDELIA
Okay, and then "Pattern Run" right? Or "Go To
End". That's it.
HARMONY
Maybe... I think...

CORDELIA
Well, what does the book say?
(as Harmony looks it up)
So anyway, I come out of the bathroom and she
comes running at me with a stick, screaming, "I'm
gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!" I swear.

GUY
(leaning in)
Who?

CORDELIA
Buffy.

HARMONY
The new girl.

GUY
What's her deal?

CORDELIA
She's crazed!

HARMONY
Did you hear about her old school? Booted.

CORDELIA
I exhibit no surprise.

GUY
Why was she kicked out?

CORDELIA
'Cause she's a psycho-loony.

WILLOW
No, she's not.

Silence, as Cordelia registers the concept that Willow just contradicted her.

CORDELIA
What?
WILLOW
She's not a psycho. You don't even know her.

CORDELIA
Excuse me? Who gave you permission to exist? Do I
horn in on your private discussions? No. Why?
Because you're boring.

Willow looks down, hurt. She stands and takes some pages that have come up on the printer. The girls turn back to their project.

HARMONY
There. I think the program's done.
CORDELIA
Finally, the nightmare ends. Now how do we save
it?

WILLOW
(as she exits)
"Deliver."

CORDELIA
(staring at the screen)
Deliver -- where is that -- Oh!

ANGLE: A KEY

Marked "DEL". Cordelia hits it.

Long pause, the two girls staring at the screen, their smiles about to melt into perplexity as we

CUT TO:
INT. TUNNELS - LATER

Buffy and Xander are still making their way through the dark. The banter quotient has plummeted -- they're both fairly tense.

Buffy looks around, brow furrowed.

BUFFY
They're close
XANDER
How can you tell?

BUFFY
No rats.

Xander doesn't love that information, but he says nothing. Still they progress, until:

XANDER
Over there. What's that?
He indicates a small, dark side-chamber. Nothing can be seen past the first few inches.

They come up to it. Xander pulls out his flashlight, shines it.

ANGLE: IN THE CHAMBER

A beam of light finds a body, lying face down. It looks like

XANDER
Jesse!
BUFFY
Oh, no...

She starts forward, Xander keeping the light on her. Goes over to the body, reaches out --

and Jesse JUMPS UP, brandishing a pipe. He's about to slam her with it when Xander calls out:

XANDER
Jesse!
JESSE
(stops, amazed)
Xander?

He drops the pipe and the two friends hug. Xander pulls away, looking him over.

XANDER
Jesse, man, are you okay?
JESSE
I'm not okay on an epic scale. We gotta get out
of here!

He indicates his leg -- he's been chained to the wall.

XANDER
It's cool! Buffy's a superhero!
The superhero frowns at the chain, feels it.

BUFFY
(to Jesse)
Hold on.
She takes the pipe he dropped and SMASHES the look on his shackles. It's not a quiet operation.

XANDER
You think anybody heard that?
ANGLE: A TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

A few black shapes move in the shadows, hearing it.

ANGLE: BUFFY AND THE OTHERS

They start out.

JESSE
They knew you were gonna come. They said that I - 
I was the bait...
XANDER
Oh, now you tell us.

JESSE
I've seen their leader.

The look in his eyes describes their leader in detail.

Buffy leads the two boys back through the tunnel. She stops.

Shadows move at the other end.

BUFFY
Oops.
JESSE
Oh, no, no...

BUFFY
Do you know another way out?

JESSE
I don't, uh, maybe?

XANDER
Come on.

They truck out the other way.

CUT TO:
INT. A JUNCTION OF TUNNELS - A SECOND LATER

They come into this one, moving at a good clip. Try one avenue --

Eyes gleam in the dark. Whispered LAUGHS drift at us.

They turn back, pause at a fork.

JESSE
Wait, wait. They brought me through here! There's
a way up. I hope.
They take off.

CUT TO:
INT. A SUBTERRANEAN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They run in, vampires approaching slowly behind them. Look around, horror growing on their faces.

There is no door. There is no exit. Buffy and Xander look about them, frantically.

BUFFY
I don't think this is the way out.
She goes back to the doorway they came in, listens for the approaching vampires.

XANDER
We can't fight our way back through those
things... what do we do?
JESSE
I've got an idea...

And the CAMERA PANS over to Jesse standing right behind Xander. His visage grotesque, his smile icy. He's a vampire.

JESSE
You can die.
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT TWO
Act Three
INT. A SUBTERRANEAN ROOM - TWO SECONDS LATER
Xander backs away from Jesse. Buffy looks from him to the entrance, not sure what to do.

ANGLE: THE ENTRANCE

We HEAR approaching vampires, see shadows begin to move, thrown on the outer wall by figures down the hall.

XANDER
Jesse... Man, I'm sorry...
JESSE
Sorry? I feel good, Xander. I feel strong.

Buffy grabs the door, tries to close it. But it's tick metal, rusted open.

JESSE
I'm connected, man. To everything. I can hear the 
worms in the earth.
XANDER
Well, that's a plus.

JESSE
I know what the Master wants. I'll serve his
purpose. That means you die. And I feed.

BUFFY
Xander! The cross!

Xander holds it up -- and Jesse stops coming toward him. The smiles leaves his face.

Buffy continues trying to shut the door -- it's beginning to budge. But coming down the hall are:

ANGLE: THE VAMPIRES

Making their way down the hall to the door. They most slowly, grinning -- sure of victory.

XANDER
Jesse. Man, we're buds. Can't you remember?
JESSE
You're like a shadow to me now.

Xander moves forward, cross in hand.

XANDER
Then get out of my face.
Jesse stumbles back, pissed. Xander backs him toward the door.

Buffy continues to strain. The vampires approach.

Jesse lashes out, knocks the cross from Xander's grasp. He grins -- and then Buffy grabs him from behind and HURLS him out of the room, knocking vampires over like bowling pins.

BUFFY
Help me!
Xander snaps out of his shock and comes to the door with her. With both their backs to it, they slam it shut --

--an arm SHOOTS in, grasping for them. Buffy opens the door slightly and slams it again till the arm withdraws. She bolts the door, breathing heavily.

XANDER
I can't believe it... we were too late.
A resounding THUD shudders the door. The vampires are gonna break it down.

BUFFY
We need to get out of here.
XANDER
There is no out of here!

Another THUD and the door begins to buckle on its hinges. Buffy looks around -- there is some junk lying around. She throws it out of the way to see if there is a doorway behind it. No joy.

Xander also looks around. He spies:

ANGLE: AN AIR VENT

We can see just a hint of an air vent's grating behind a metal sheet. It's high up in the shadows.

XANDER
What's that?
Buffy sees it too. She throws a box down, steps on it to reach the vent. Pulls away the metal sheet, revealing the grate. It's big enough to climb through.

She begins trying to pry the grate open with her bare hands.

Another THUD. Xander looks from Buffy to the door.

Buffy pulls, behind a corner.

The door comes off its hinges enough for a vampire to put his fingers through, grip it.

Buffy RIPS the grating loose, throws it aside.

BUFFY
Come on!
And a vampire SHOOTS out of the air vent at her, grabbing her head.

The door comes out enough for a vampire to get its face in.

Buffy pulls the vampire all the way out of the vent, throws it to the floor. Jumps down on top of it.

BUFFY
(to Xander)
Go!
He runs by, climbs on the box as Buffy sinks a stake into the vampire's back. He sticks the flashlight in:

ANGLE: IN THE AIR VENT

Nothing. Clear.

He crawls in, starts worming his way down it.

ANGLE: THE DOOR

Breaks down. Vampires pile in.

Buffy jumps up and pulls herself into the air vent.

CUT TO:
INT. AIR VENT - CONTINUOUS

The two of them crawl along in the dark, the vampires at their heels.

They come to a wider space, with a ladder going up. Sunlight can be seen through the grating at the very top.

XANDER
Up?
BUFFY
UP!

He starts climbing, Buffy right behind him.

He gets to the top and opens the grating, climbs into:

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

It's deserted as Xander rolls out, reaches in to help Buffy up. She is almost out when

ANGLE: A HAND

grabs her ankle, starts pulling her back down.

She pulls up, bringing the hand up into the sunlight. It beings to SMOKE -- we hear a SHRIEK and it is withdrawn.

Buffy rolls out, slams the grating shut.

For a moment both of them just lie there, catching their breath.

INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

Giles is still pouring over his notes when Willow enters. He looks up, hoping to see

GILES
Buffy?
WILLOW
It's just me. So there's no word?

GILES
Not as of yet.

WILLOW
Well, I'm sure they're... great.

GILES
Did you find anything of interest?

She sits, shows him copied articles as she talks.

WILLOW
I think maybe. I looked through the old papers,
around the time of that big earthquake back in
'37. And for several months before it, there was
a rash of murders.
GILES
Great! I mean, not great in a good way... Go on.

WILLOW
They sound like the kind you were looking for.
Throats, blood. Months, and not even a clue.

GILES
It's all coming together. I rather wish it weren't.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

We see a candle being lit, the last of a row. Darla steps back from it, the taper in her hand glowing softly.

As she does, another vampire does the same on the opposite wall. They are at the back of the church, staring ahead. The rows of candles run up to the altar, where the Master stands waiting.

CHANTING can be heard, a low, primal whisper.

Luke steps forward, pulling off his shirt. He steps forward, kneels before the Master. The Master holds out his hand. Luke leans forward and kisses it. The Master turn him open palm up and Luke kisses that as well. Gently, Luke takes the Master's wrist in his hand, brings his lips to that as well.

And bites it.

The Master winces, shuts his eyes. Luke feeds for a few moments, the rears his head back with holy pain.

THE MASTER
My blood runs with yours. My soul is your
province.
LUKE
My body is your instrument.

The Master takes a drop of blood from his wrist, dabs it on Luke's forehead, painting the three-pointed star. He speaks to the assembled:

THE MASTER
On this most hallowed night, we are as one. Luke
is the Vessel. Every soul he takes shall feed me.
Their souls will grant me the power to free
myself. Tonight I will walk the Earth... and the
stars themselves will hide.
CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Buffy and Xander enter, somewhat the worse for their adventure. Willow takes one look at their faces and doesn't have to ask. She does anyway.

WILLOW
Did you find Jesse?
XANDER
Yeah.

WILLOW
Was he dead?

BUFFY
Worse.

She sits heavily.

BUFFY
I'm sorry, Willow. We were too late. And they
were waiting for us.
WILLOW
At least you two are okay.

Xander kicks a trash bin in frustration.

XANDER
I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and
say they're not good.
BUFFY
So, Giles, you got anything that can make this
day worse?

GILES
How about the end of the world.

BUFFY
I knew I could count on you.

GILES
This is what we know. Some sixty years ago a very
old, very powerful vampire came to this shore,
and not just to feed.

BUFFY
He came 'cause this town is a mystical whoosit?

GILES
Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it
Boca Del Infierno -- roughly translated:
Hellmouth. A sort of portal from this reality to
the next. This vampire hoped to open it.

BUFFY
Bring the demons back.

XANDER
End of the world.

WILLOW
But he blew it. Or, I mean, there was an
earthquake that swallowed about half the town.
And him too -- or at least there were no more
vampire-type killings after.

GILES
Opening dimensional portals is tricky business.
Odds are he got himself stuck. Like a cork in a
bottle.

XANDER
And this Harvest thing is to get him out?

GILES
It comes once in a century, on this night. A
Master can draw power from one of his minions
while it feeds. Enough power to break free, and
to open the portal. The minion is called the
Vessel, and he bears this symbol.

He shows them a sketch of the three-pointed star.

BUFFY
So, I dust anyone sporting this look, and no
Harvest.
GILES
Simply put, yes.

BUFFY
Any clue where this little get-together is being
held?

GILES
Well, there are a number of possibilities--

XANDER
They're going to the Bronze.

WILLOW
Are you sure?

XANDER
Come on, tasty young morsels all over the place.
Anyway, that's where Jesse's gonna be. Trust me.

GILES
Then we need to get there. The sun will be down
before long.

They head out toward the door.

BUFFY
I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.
GILES
What for?

BUFFY
Supplies.

CUT TO:
ANGLE: THE SUN

Big and red, sinking low.

INT. BUFFY'S BEDROOM - DUSK

The last rays are streaming in as Buffy enters, starts going through her closet.

JOYCE (O.S.)
Buffy?
Buffy's mom, JOYCE SUMMERS, enters. Buffy keeps going through her clothes, picking out a good slaying outfit.

JOYCE
You're going out?
BUFFY
I have to.

JOYCE
I didn't hear you come in last night.

BUFFY
I was quiet.

JOYCE
It's happening again, isn't it?

Buffy stops, looks at her.

JOYCE
I got a call from your new principal. Says you
missed some classes today.
BUFFY
I was... running an errand.

She pulls an old trunk out of her closet. She opens it, starts going through it.

JOYCE
We haven't finished unpacking and I'm getting
calls from your principal.
BUFFY
Mom, I promise you, it's not gonna be like
before. But I have to go.

JOYCE
No.

BUFFY
Mom...

Buffy looks at the window, at the growing dark.

JOYCE
The tapes all say I should get used to saying it.
No.
BUFFY
This is important.

JOYCE
I know. You have to go out or it'll be the end of
the world. Everything is life or death when
you're a sixteen year old girl.

BUFFY
Mom, I don't have time to talk about it--

JOYCE
You've got all night, Buffy. You're not going
anywhere. Now you can stay up here and sulk if
you want. I won't hold it against you. But if you
want to come down, I'll make us some dinner.

Joyce leaves, closing the door quietly but firmly behind her. After a moment, Buffy reaches into the truck.

ANGLE: IN THE TRUNK

Girl stuff, memorabilia, Teen Beat magazines.

Buffy reaches in and lifts out the inside -- the trunk has a false bottom. Below it stakes, crosses, host, garlic, and a widemouthed jar of holy water.

Buffy takes out a particularly deadly looking stake. It fits in her hand like it's part of it. She stuffs it into a bag, along with a few other items.

She stands, goes to the door. Listens by it.

She gets to the window, opens it. Starts crawling out.

From the balcony, we look down on a pool game in progress. Tilt up to see Cordelia holding court at a table.

CORDELIA
Senior boys are the only way to go. They're just
a better class of person. The boys in our grade?
Forget about it. They're children. Like Jesse -- 
did you see him last night? The way he follows me
around... He's like a little puppy dog: you just
want to put him to sleep. Senior boys have
mystery, they have ... what's the word I'm
searching for? Cars.
A Cordette starts to speak. Cordelia interrupts.

CORDELIA
I'm just not the type to settle. If I go into a
clothing store, I always have to have the most
expensive thing not because it's expensive, but
because it costs more.
A Cordette starts to speak.

CORDELIA
Hello! Miss Motormouth -- can I get a sentence
finished? Oh! I love this song!
She gets up, friends in tow, and heads to the balcony.

INT. THE BRONZE - MOMENTS LATER
Cordelia is still dancing with her friends, having a good time.

Jesse makes his way slowly through the crowd, not towards but around her, his eyes never leaving her. She sees him too -- and for the first time, doesn't look away in disgust. There's something different about him.

A SLOW SONG starts playing, and Cordelia stops dancing, heads off the floor.

He's suddenly standing in her way. Smiling that distant smile.

CORDELIA
What do you want?
It's the old attitude, but she's not fooling anyone.

He takes her hand, starts leading her onto the floor.

CORDELIA
Hey! Hello, caveman-brain! What do you think
you're doing?
He turns back to her, smiles winningly.

JESSE
Shut up.
Brings her to the middle of the floor and starts dancing with her. He holds her, hardly touching her, moving slowly.

CORDELIA
Just this one dance...
She moves closer to him.

Luke stands over him. His face inches from the Bouncer's.

LUKE
Get inside.
The Bouncer complies instantly.

INT. THE BRONZE - A MOMENT LATER

Once inside, the vampires spread out, each heading for an exit. Two of them stay behind and close off the front.

Darla heads for the door by the stage that leads backstage. Goes in.

One goes to the bar -- swings over it and stands in front of the door.

One heads upstairs.

And Luke climbs up on stage.

Darla checks that the exit door is secure. Then she goes over to the fuse box, flips a switch.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

The main lights and the music go off. There are GASPS, MURMURS. A voice from the stage calls out:

LUKE
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no cause for alarm.
On stage, a single spot continues to shine. Luke steps into the light. His face is rivetingly awful.

LUKE
Actually, there is cause for alarm. It just won't
do any good.
Major GASPS and MURMURS at the sight of him.

ANGLE: THE FRONT DOOR

A couple tries to get out. The vampire standing guard -- his normal face gone -- shakes his head no.

They shrink back from him.

ANGLE: CORDELIA

She stares at the stage, Jesse's hands still on her.

CORDELIA
I thought there wasn't any band tonight.
She looks at Jesse to see his face has changed as well. Starts to struggle but he holds her, pulls her back into the dark under the stairs.

ANGLE: DARLA

re-emerges from backstage. Looks up at Luke on stage.

LUKE
This is a glorious night. It's also the last one
any of you shall ever see.
(beat)
Bring me the first!
One of the vampires pushes the Bouncer up on stage.

BOUNCER
What do you guys want, you want money? Man,
what's wrong with your faces?
Luke grabs him by the scruff on the neck, squeezing any further conversation out of him.

LUKE
Watch me, people!
(to the Bouncer)
Their fear is elixir. It's almost like blood.
As he brings the Bouncer to him and bites his neck, sucking the life out of him in huge gulps.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

The Master stands, power coursing through him -- visibly. It lights him up.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Luke continues feeding. After a bit he pulls his head back, throws the Bouncer's dead body from him.

LUKE
Next!
CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Buffy and the others run up to the front door. She tries it -- it's locked.

BUFFY
It's locked.
GILES
We're too late.

BUFFY
Well, I didn't know I was gonna get grounded!

XANDER
(re: door)
Can you break it down?

BUFFY
Not this thing. You guys try the back entrance. 
I'll find my own way.

GILES
Right.
(to Xander and Willow)
Come on.

BUFFY
Guys!

They stop. Buffy hands them her bag of tricks.

INT. THE BRONZE

They are really scared now, seeing corpses (two now) lying before them. There is some screaming, some whimpering.

ANGLE: CORNER UNDER THE STAIRS

Darla is having a face off with Jesse, who holds Cordelia.

JESSE
This one's mine.
DARLA
They are all for the Master.

JESSE
I don't get one?

ANGLE: UPSTAIRS WINDOW BY THE BALCONY

The window opens slowly, an oblivious vampire before it. Buffy slips in.

She looks down at the stage, at Luke.

LUKE
I feel him rising! I need another!
She sees the three-pointed star on his head.

BUFFY
(to herself)
The Vessel...
The vampire turns, hearing this. He grabs Buffy, dragging her up to he middle of the balcony to present her to Luke.

LUKE
Tonight in his ascension. Tonight will be History
at its end! Yours is a glorious sacrifice.
Degradation most holy.
(looking around)
What, no volunteers?
Darla emerges, holding Cordelia.

DARLA
Here's a pretty one.
CORDELIA
Noooo...

Darla drags her toward the stage, hands her over to Luke.

ANGLE: BUFFY

slips out of the vampire's grasp and THROWS him off the balcony. He lands WHAM on his back right in front of the stage.

Silence.

BUFFY
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you in the middle something.
LUKE
YOU!

BUFFY
You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?

LUKE
(smiles)
I hoped you'd come.

CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

The exit door bursts open, a metal pipe-wielding Giles behind it. He starts in, the other two behind him.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

A vampire comes at Buffy from the side and she grabs him, THROWS him into the hookah pit.

He scrambles back up and she FLIPS herself over backwards, goes through the hole and lands on top of the pool table. A cue is lying on the table -- she does a hand spring and lands on the floor holding on the cue.

A vampire rushes her from the side --

ANGLE: BUFFY

without looking, she JAMS the cue end into his heart. We don't see him -- we just hear the PLUNGE. And when Buffy lets go, the cue stays right where it is.

BUFFY
Okay, Vessel-boy. You want blood?
She steps forward just as the cue rises like the arm of a guard gate and we hear the vampire's body THUD to the floor.

LUKE
I want yours. Only yours.
BUFFY
Then come and get it.

Cordelia, seeing her chance, tries to break free of Luke's grasp. He throws her to one side --

--and Buffy runs, LEAPS at him, slams her fist into his face. This one really hurts, and he stumbles back in pain.

He comes back at her but she ducks, comes back up with a roundhouse kick to the face. Another score.

She ships out her stake, comes at him -- but he blocks. Nails her in the face, and she skids into the corner, badly hurt. The stake falls at his feet.

ANGLE: DOOR TO BACKSTAGE

It bursts open, Xander nearly falling out.

He looks about him -- no vampires in the immediate vicinity -- and beings herding people out.

XANDER
Come on!
CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

The people rush past Willow and Giles, who push them towards the exit.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Buffy kicks Luke in the chest. He flies back, landing hard. She's about to go in for the kill when she sees.

ANGLE: A VAMPIRE

going for Xander, who's too busy shepherding people out to notice.

Buffy turns to the drum kit and kicks the cymbal right off the stand. She catches it in mid air --

--the vampire reaches Xander, grabs him--

--Buffy hurls the cymbal, frisbee style--

--the vampire turns, eyes wide, and the cymbal flies straight at his neck--

As he hears the SLICE, his eyes follow the trajectory of the liberated head.

XANDER
(softly)
Heads up...
ANGLE: BUFFY

barely has time to turn before Luke GRABS her from behind, lifting her up in a crushing bear hug.

ANGLE: XANDER

He is going to help Buffy when he hears a SHRIEK, turns and sees:

ANGLE: CORDELIA

is being dragged off into the area below the stairs by Jesse.

He throws her to the ground, kneeling above her. Pinning her.

JESSE
Hold still! You're not helping.
Xander appears behind Jesse, holding a stake. He could plunge it right through the back into the heart, but he hesitates.

XANDER
Jesse, man... don't make me do it.
Jesse looks around, grinning inhumanly.

JESSE
Buddy...
ANGLE: BUFFY

Is failing to get out of Luke's grasp. He squeezes even harder and she beings to lose consciousness.

LUKE
I've always wanted to kill a Slayer...
CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

People are still rushing out.

GILES
Come on! We've got to open the front as well!
He heads for the door to the main room and Darla JUMPS on him, digging for his throat. His stake is knocked out of his hand as he topples to the ground.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Xander takes a step back as Jesse rises, faces him.

XANDER
Jesse, I know there's still a part of you in
there.
JESSE
(exasperated)
Okay, let's deal with this. Jesse was an 
excruciating loser who couldn't get a date with 
anyone in the sighted community! Look at me now!
I'm a new man!

He grabs Xander and HURLS him against the wall. Xander falls in a heap to the cowering Cordelia.

JESSE
See, the old Jesse would have reasoned with you.
CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Willow frantically digs through Buffy's bag, looking for a weapon. She pulls out the jar of holy water.

Darla continues to struggle with Giles -- has him pinned on the ground.

WILLOW (O.S.)
Get off him!
Darla turns to face Willow and is DOUSED with holy water right in the face.

SCREAMING, she brings her hands to her face, smoke pouring out from between her fingers.

Giles pushes her off him, getting up to face her. But Darla is already stumbling out the exit in smoking agony.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Buffy is limp in Luke's grasp. Head dangling forward.

LUKE
Master, taste of this and be free.
He opens wide, leans in -- and Buffy HEADBUTTS him with the back of her head, sends him staggering back.

BUFFY
How'd it taste?
She is weak, despite her bravado. She grabs the cymbal stand, holds it as a weapon. Looks around her -- and sees:

ANGLE: THE WINDOW

at the back of the stage. It's painted black, one huge pane.

Buffy looks at it, at Luke.

ANGLE: XANDER

Jesse picks him up again, fury etching his demon face.

JESSE
I'm sick of you getting in the way, you know?
Cordelia, she's gonna live forever. You're not.
Xander holds the stake up to Jesse's chest, determined but scared.

JESSE
Oh, right! Put me out of my misery! You don't
have the g--
And a fleeing woman SLAMS into Jesse from behind, driving him onto the stake. He drags himself on a stunned Xander, dying.

And then he's dust. Xander barely has time to react before two more vampires grab him.

ANGLE: BUFFY

She swings the cymbal stand at an approaching Luke. He smiles.

LUKE
You forget. Metal can't hurt me.
BUFFY
There's something you forgot about, too.

He hesitates, doubt clouding his face.

BUFFY
Sunrise.
And she takes the stand and HURLS it right through the plate glass window at the back of the stage -- SHATTERING the entire thing.

ANGLE: LUKE

As the warm light STREAMS IN on him, he SCREAMS, raises his hands --

--and stops. Puzzled.

Buffy DRIVES the stake in through his back. He arches forward, in real agony this time.

BUFFY
It's in about nine hours, moron.
ANGLE: THE BROKEN WINDOW

And Luke realizes the light from the window is merely a streetlight, shining in the darkness.

Luke stumbles forward--

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

And the Master stumbles forward in the exact same position, the bright energy beginning to fade from him. He reaches out, nearly doubled over --

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

The last of the energy fades from the master.

THE MASTER
(weakly)
Nooooo....
He falls to his knees, reaches out blindly for support.

What he touches is the wall, once again too strong for him to bend. Fury and despair cross hi face as he looks up at it. A scream wells up inside him, and right before it bellows out, we

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Xander struggles with the remaining vampires, who hold him, their attention on the stage.

Buffy looks down at the spot where Luke's body was. After a moment, she turns her gaze slowly toward the vampires.

They look at the expression on her face for about 1/8th of a second, then they drop Xander and bolt out of the front door.

ANGLE: THE BACKSTAGE DOOR

Giles and Willow come slowly out, meet Buffy and Xander in the middle of the dance floor.

GILES
I take it it's over.
WILLOW
Did we win?

A moment, as they look about at the carnage that surrounds them. Most of the patrons have fled, though some remain, stunned and silent.

BUFFY
Well, we averted the apocalypse. You gotta give
us points for that.
ANGLE: CORDELIA

Sitting right where Jesse left her. Not a word.

XANDER
One thing's for sure. Nothing is ever gonna be
the same.
CUT TO:
EXT. FOUNTAIN QUAD - DAY

Everything is exactly the same. We see kids milling about, talking, laughing in the bright sunshine. Pick up Cordelia, walking by with her friends.

CORDELIA
Well, I heard it was rival gangs. Anyway, Buffy
totally knew these guys which is too weird. I
can't remember anything too well, but I'm telling
you, it was a freak show.
GIRL
Oh, I wish I'd been there.

And we leave them, picking up Buffy and the others nearby, crossing the other way. Xander has a look of disbelief on his face.

BUFFY
Well, what exactly were you expecting?
XANDER
I don't know! Something. The dead rose! We
should've at least had an assembly.

GILES
People have a tendency to rationalize what they
can, and forget what they can't.

BUFFY
Believe me, I've seen it happen.

WILLOW
Well, I'll never forget it. None of it.

GILES
Good. Next time you'll be prepared.

XANDER
Next time?

WILLOW
Next time is why?

GILES
We stopped the master from freeing himself and
opening the mouth of Hell. Doesn't mean he'll
stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.

WILLOW
More vampires?

GILES
Not just vampires. The next creature we face may
be something quite different.

BUFFY
I can hardly wait.

GILES
We're at a center of mystical convergence here.
We may in fact stand between the earth and total
destruction.

XANDER
Buffy, this isn't good.

BUFFY
Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I
can still get kicked out of school.

She smiles at Giles and starts off, the other two keeping up with her.

XANDER
Hey, that's a plan. 'Cause a lot of schools 
aren't on Hellmouths.
WILLOW
Maybe you could blow something up. They're really 
strict about that.

BUFFY
I was aiming for a subtle approach, like
excessive not studying.

Giles watches them go, an uneasy smile plastered on his lips.

GILES
The earth is doomed.
BLACK OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING


GILES (V.O)
This is madness.
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

GILES, deeply concerned, is staring at someone we can't see.

WIDEN TO REVEAL BUFFY, in cute CHEERLEADING OUTFIT

BUFFY
You don't like the color.
GILES
I what? I don't -- Buffy, do you
ignore everything I say? As a
rule?

BUFFY
No, I believe that's your trick. I
told you I'm going out for the
cheerleading squad.

GILES
You have a sacred birthright,
Buffy. You have been chosen to
destroy Vampires, not wave pom-poms
at people. As the Watcher, I
forbid it.

BUFFY
And you'll be stopping me how?

GILES
Dyeh, uh, well -- by appealling to
your common sense, if such a
creature exists.

BUFFY
I'll still have time to fight the
forces of evil, okay? But I want
to have a life. I want to do
something normal. Something safe.

CUT TO:
INT. ATTIC - DAY

The windows have been boarded and taped over -- tiny pinpricks of sunlight stream in to this otherwise dark place. Whatever this place is, it's not safe.

A figure moves about before us in a black, hooded robe. It pauses before a bubbling cauldron, then crosses to a shelf.

On the shelf is a doll in a cheerleading outfit. Her hands have been wrapped with bits of cloth.

The figure reaches out and takes the doll. We HOLD on the empty shelf.

CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - DAY

CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS reads a sign on the wall. Big banner showing the FIGHTING SUNNYDALE RAZORBACKS hangs next to it.

PRETTY GIRLS, in short skirts, twirl and warm up.

Buffy enters with WILLOW and XANDER.

WILLOW
Giles didn't approve, huh?
BUFFY
He totally lost his water. We
haven't even seen a vampire in a
week. I'd say he should get a
girlfriend if he wasn't so old.

WILLOW
Well, we're behind you.

XANDER
People scoff at things like school
spirit -- but when you see these
young women giving their all like
this...

AMBER, an attractive, agile girl, her feet on two chairs, slides down into an extra low split.

XANDER
(mesmerized)
...Oooh, stretchy. Where was I?
WILLOW
You were pretending that seeing
scantily-clad girls in revealing
postures was a spiritual
experience.

XANDER
What do you mean, pretending?

Xander pulls out an I.D. bracelet.

XANDER
Oh, hey. Here's a little good luck
thing for the tryouts...
BUFFY
(charmed)
What is this?

WILLOW
(less charmed)
What is that?

Buffy takes the bracelet, puts it on.

BUFFY
This is so sweet!
(reads on bracelet:)
"Yours always..."
XANDER
That was on there when I got it.
Really. They all said that.

CORDELIA, in cheerleader outfit, moves up, watches Amber stand on one leg and hold the other straight up in the air.

CORDELIA
Just look at Amber. Who does she
think she is, a Laker Girl?
WILLOW
I heard she turned them down.

A SENIOR CHEERLEADER (Cordelia two years hence) moves to the judge's table with two other SENIOR CHEERLEADERS.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Let's begin with...
(reads from list)
Amber Grove. If you're not
auditioning move off the floor.
Xander, Willow, Buffy, Cordelia move back. Willow spots AMY MADISON (in cheerleader outfit), nice girl, a little tightly wound today.

WILLOW
Hi Amy.
AMY
Hi.

WILLOW
I didn't know you wanted to be a
cheerleader. You lost a lot of
weight.

AMY
Had to.

WILLOW
Do you know Buffy?

AMY
Hi.
(to Buffy)
Oh how I hate this, let me count
the ways.

Buffy smiles, warming to Amy's honesty.

They watch Amber's routine -- she's really good.

AMY
She trained with Benson -- he's the
best coach money can buy.
BUFFY
They have cheerleading coaches?

AMY
Oh yeah. You don't have...? I train
with my mom, three hours in the
morning, three at night.

BUFFY
That kind of quality time with my
mom would probably lead to some
quality matricide.

AMY
(smiles)
I know it's kinda hokey... but
she's really great.

Cordelia, standing nearby, feigns boredom with Amber's performance, turns her back.

Everyone else watches Amber as SMOKE BEGINS TO EMANATE from her pom-poms.

BUFFY
What the ... ?
WILLOW
That girl's on fire.

CORDELIA
(back still turned)
Enough with the hyperbole.

Amber stops, drops the pom-poms. The smoke is coming from her - and her hands and forearms suddenly burst into FLAMES! Amber SCREAMS! (as do other girls.) Buffy vaults to the large RAZORBACKS BANNER, rips it down and tackles Amber, wrapped her tightly in it and smothering the flames.

BUFFY
(to Amber)
It's okay, you're gonna be okay...
Off Buffy,

BLACK OUT.
END OF TEASER
Act One
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

The foursome are gathered.


BUFFY
I've been slaying Vampires for more
than a year now. I've seen some
pretty cringeworthy stuff, but
nobody's hands ever got toasted.
GILES
I imagine not.

BUFFY
So this is not a vampire problem.

GILES
No.

BUFFY
But it is funky, right? Not of
the norm?

GILES
Quite. Spontaneous human
combustion is rare, and
scientifically unexplainable. But
there've been cases reported for
hundreds of years. Usually all
that's left is a pile of ashes.

WILLOW
That's all that would have been
left of Amber if it hadn't been for
Buffy.

XANDER
So we have no idea what caused
this? That's a comfort.

GILES
Well, that is the thrill of living
on a hellmouth -- one has a
veritable cornucopia of fiends,
devils and ghouls to engage --
(off their looks)
Pardon me for finding the glass
half full.

BUFFY
Any common denominator in cases of
spontaneous combustion?

GILES
Rage. In most cases the person who
combusted was terribly angry or
upset.

XANDER
So maybe Amber's got this power.
To make herself be on fire. Like
the Human Torch, only it hurts.

BUFFY
So I should get the skinny on
Amber. See if she's had any
colorful episodes before.

WILLOW
That means hacking illegally into
the school's computer system -- at
last something I can do.

She moves to a computer.

XANDER
I'll ask around about her.
BUFFY
Guys, you don't have to get
involved.

XANDER
What do you mean? We're a team!
Aren't we a team?

WILLOW
Yeah, you're the Slayer and we're
like the slayerettes.

BUFFY
I don't want you putting yourselves
in danger.

XANDER
I laugh in the face of danger.
Then I hide till it goes away.

BUFFY
Okay, well, I'm psyched for the
help.
(to Giles)
And what if we find out Amber
didn't cause this herself?

GILES
Then we will have to determine who
or what did. And deal with it
accordingly.

XANDER
(off Buffy's worried
look)
Hey, we've fought vampires!
Anything else'll be a walk in the
park.

BUFFY
I hope so...

CUT TO:
INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

There are crates strewn about. Joyce is opening them with a crowbar (and some difficulty).

Buffy enters, throws her books on the kitchen table.

BUFFY
Hey, Mom.
JOYCE
Hi. How was school?

BUFFY
A reverent joy. What's all this?

JOYCE
It's for the tribal art display.

Buffy picks up a statue, looks at it.

BUFFY
Oh. Cool.
She sits down on the table, grabbing a donut. Watches Joyce a minute -- Joyce hasn't looked back at her -- before offering:

BUFFY
We had tryouts today.
JOYCE
Great! How'd it go?

BUFFY
Well, I didn't get to try out yet.
There was an accident. Pretty fierce
competition, though.

JOYCE
I know you'll do fine. Keep on
plugging. Just have to get back on
the horse.

Joyce tries to pry open the crate on the table next to Buffy. It won't budge.

BUFFY
Mom?
JOYCE
(finally looking around)
Yeah?

BUFFY
What was I trying out for?

JOYCE
(stops, stumped)
Um... some activity? I have no
idea, I'm sorry.

BUFFY
That's okay. Your platitudes are
good for all occasions.

JOYCE
I'm distracted. I've got a lot of
inventory to go through here. This
is my gallery's first major show.

She gives up, turns to another crate.

JOYCE
It might not physically kill you to
give me a hand...
Buffy casually flips the lid off the unopenable crate with one hand.

BUFFY
It was cheerleading tryouts.
JOYCE
Oh! Good. I'm glad you're taking
that up again. Keep you out of
trouble.

BUFFY
I'm not in trouble, mom.

JOYCE
No, not yet. I mean -- you stopped
cheerleading right before the
trouble. So it's good you're going
back --

She pulls a statue of a man halfway out of a crate, stops.

JOYCE
Oh, dear.
She puts it back.

BUFFY
What is it?
JOYCE
Fertility statue. You don't need
to see it.

Buffy heads for the fridge. Looking in:

BUFFY
You know, this girl Amy trains with
her mom like three hours a day.
(closes the fridge)
Sounds like her mom's really into
it.
JOYCE
(Absently)
Sounds like her mom doesn't have a
whole lot to do.

She exits, carrying a couple of pieces. Buffy watches her a moment, then looks down into the crate with the fertility statue. Her eyes go wide.

BUFFY
Jeepers.
CUT TO:
EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING

SENIOR CHEERLEADER (O.S.)
Despite the terrible thing that
happened yesterday...
INT. THE GYM - DAY

Cheerleader tryouts. Buffy, Amy, Cordelia (wearing pink headband) and ten or twelve others.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
...we still have to pick new
cheerleaders. If you make the team,
you'll find your name posted in the
Quad after lunch. Let's begin with
group performance -- Cordelia,
Buffy, Amy, Morgan, Janice and
Lishanne.
LISHANNE is an attractive African American. The five girls walk to the center of the gym. Amy glares at her hands.

AMY
Why do my hands have to sweat when
I get nervous?
BUFFY
Don't worry, you'll do great.

MUSIC UP. The girls perform a group cheer (to be choreographed.)

It includes synchronized leaps, twirls and basketball cheer, ala:

LISHANNE
We're Sunnydale, Sunnydale
GROUP CHEER
We Never Fail, Never Fail

LISHANNE
Jump and Shoot, Swish and Score

GROUP CHEER
The Other Team Is Such a Bore
YEAHHH!

Morgan is okay. Lishanne is great. Cordelia is surprisingly good, as is Buffy, still a little rusty but impressive.

Amy starts out well but tries too hard -- misses a couple of synchronized moves -- and, in the big finish (each girl doing a cartwheel and sliding to their knees one at a time) AMY'S HANDS slip on the floor, and she careens into:

CORDELIA
(to judges)
You saw that, right? That wasn't
me.
CUT TO:
INT. GYM FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Amy, in cheerleader outfit, depressed, stands before a big trophy display case (includes cheerleader trophies and photos).

Buffy, dressed for school, exits locker room, moves up. Looks at CHEERLEADER PHOTO. Under the photo, it reads: 1977 -- TRI-COUNTY BEST.

AMY
That's my mom.
BUFFY
No...
(reads name)
Catherine Madison. Get down with
your bad self.

AMY
Her nickname was Catherine The
Great: she took that team and made
them tri-county champions, no one's
ever done that before or since. She
and my dad were homecoming King and
Queen, got married right after
graduation.

BUFFY
That's kinda romantic.

AMY
Well... he was a big loser,
couldn't make any money, took off
with Miss Trailer Trash when I was
twelve.

BUFFY
Okay, that part's less romantic.
My folks split up, too.

AMY
Drag, huh. He left my mom with
nothing. She put herself through
cosmetology school, bought me
everything I ever wanted and never
gained a single pound...

BUFFY
She sounds great, Amy, but that
doesn't mean you have to, you know,
lock step as far as the
cheerleading thing --

Amy turns to Buffy, eyes filling.

AMY
It's just, she was the best, and I
can't get my body to move like
hers. I choked in there so bad.
Amy looks very sad and forlorn as Willow enters. She tries to put on a brave face, heads for the GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM.

AMY
...I gotta get changed...
WILLOW
(to Amy's departing back)
Hi Amy...
(to Buffy)
She okay?

BUFFY
She's wiggin' about her mother...
(re: photo)
...the big cheer queen back when.

WILLOW
Yeah. Her mom's kinda...

BUFFY
Nazi-like?

WILLOW
Heil. If she gains an ounce she
padlocks the fridge and won't eat
anything but broth.

BUFFY
So Mommie Dearest is really...
Mommie Dearest.

WILLOW
There's a bitter streak -- but
Amy's nice. We used to hang in
Junior High. When her mom'd go on a
broth kick Amy'd come to my house
and we'd just stuff ourselves with
brownies.

BUFFY
Any word on Amber?

WILLOW
(pulls paper from
bookbag)
Nothing thrilling. Average student
-- got detention once for
smoking -- regular smoking, with a
cigarette. Not being smoky. All
pretty normal.

BUFFY
We'll just have to see what happens
next. Maybe nothing will.

They head out.

CUT TO:
INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY

MOVING CREEPY-CAM through the dimly lit room. Past the cold floors, the metal lockers...

Amy, alone, changes into her school clothes. Her movements are slow and tired. She rubs an aching shoulder -- hears a NOISE, whips her head around. HER POV - The empty locker room. Spooky. A lone shower DRIPS.

She instinctively does up a couple of buttons on her blouse, as if to protect herself, turning slowly around in a circle -- and suddenly

CORDELIA IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HER

Amy jumps, frightened. Cordelia is perfectly dressed and coiffed. She holds the pink headband she wore during auditions. She speaks very quietly and in a chillingly kind voice, gesturing very close to Amy's face with the headband.

CORDELIA
I have a dream. It's me on the
Cheerleading Squad, adored by every
Varsity male as far as the eye can
see. We have to achieve our dreams,
Amy, otherwise we wither and die.
AMY
Look, I'm sorry about --

CORDELIA
Shhh. If your supreme klutziness
out there today takes me out of the
running you are going to be so very
beyond sorry. Have a nice day.

Cordelia hurls the headband into her own locker and SLAMS IT! She walks out -- her locker swinging back open. Amy takes a breath, watching Cordelia's departing back.

CUT TO:
EXT. QUAD DAY

Kids mill about after lunch. Xander and Willow walk through them.

WILLOW
I told Buffy about Amber.
XANDER
Cool. Was she wearing it?
(off her look)
The bracelet. She was wearing it,
right? That's pretty much like
we're going out.

WILLOW
Except without the hugging or
kissing or her knowing about it.

XANDER
So now I'm a figure of fun. I
should just ask, right?

WILLOW
Won't know till you ask.

XANDER
See, this is why you're cool.
You're like a guy. You're my guy
friend that knows about girl stuff.

WILLOW
Oh great. I'm a guy.

He sees the Senior Cheerleader moving towards the bulletin board, list in hand. Girls begin to gather.

XANDER
Hey, they're posting the list!
He bolts for:

EXT. QUAD - BULLETIN BOARD - DAY

A sizable crowd has gathered. The Senior Cheerleader posts the list and goes. Girls stand on tiptoe, push and poke, trying to see. Buffy and Amy are on the periphery as Xander and Willow move up. A GIRL IN TEARS breaks out of the crowd, runs off. Lishanne, reading the list, jumps up and down with some friends.

LISHANNE
Yess!
AMY
I can't take this...

Buffy tries to wedge into the crowd but TWO CONTENDERS step right in front of her.

XANDER
Spot me, I'm goin' in.
Xander takes a little dive into the throng, works his way to the front where he finds himself nose to nose with Cordelia at the list. He lets her check it out first.

XANDER
Women and children first.
ANGLE - EDGE OF THRONG

Cordelia emerges, triumphant.

CORDELIA
(to Amy)
You're lucky.
AMY
I made it?

CORDELIA
I made it.

Cordelia moves off; Xander, rubbing his arm, emerges from the throng.

XANDER
One of those girls hit me really
hard -- we have to start testing
for steroids --
(to Buffy and Amy)
-- okay, not only did you make it,
but you, Miss Summers, are the
number one alternate and Amy's the
number three!
Amy's face falls, she turns and walks off.

XANDER
Any what better way to celebrate
than with a romantic drive-through
for two at --
WILLOW
Xander, alternates are the ones who
didn't make the team. They only
fill in if something happens to the
ones who did.

BUFFY
(moving after Amy)
Excuse me.

XANDER
For I am Xander, King of the
Cretins, and all lesser cretins
must bow before me.

ANGLE - AMY, TRYING TO CONTROL HER FEELINGS

As Buffy moves up.

BUFFY
At least it's over. And you know
what I think we should do about it?
Brownie pig-out, my house, now.
AMY
How many more hours a day can I
practice? How much more can I do?
This would never have happened to
my mom. Never.

Amy takes off. Buffy watches her go.

EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY

A Sunnydale two story, a little darker and foreboding than the others on the street. WE PUSH in on the house, moving up towards the attic window.

INT. AMY'S ATTIC - DAY

Creepy, dark and strange. Walls adorned with witch and warlock paraphernalia. Burning black candles.

The floor is dominated by a large hand-painted pentagram on top of which sits the classic black iron cauldron, hideous bubbling brew cooking inside.

A HAND ENTERS FRAME drops a serpent's head into the brew. We don't see the robed WITCH'S face but we (dimly) HEAR HER CHANTING.

WITCH
...Lord of Darkness, Lord of
Night... accept they supplicant's
sacrifice...
The Witch moves to a ROW OF DOLLS neatly lined up on the wall. Pretty dolls, Barbie-types.

The hand picks up a brunette doll. The hand brings the doll to the cauldron. We now see CORDELIA'S PINK HEAD BAND in the Witch's other hand. The CHANTING grows more intense as the pink headband is wrapped round and round the Cordelia doll's face, tighter and tighter.

WITCH
...reap thy vengeance with keen and
cruel might... send thy sudden
darkness out of darkest night.
And the hand drops the Cordelia doll in the brew. The pink headband soaks up the foul-colored liquid and the little doll sinks from sight.

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT ONE
Act Two
INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - MORNING

Buffy is getting her books together. Joyce enters carrying an old yearbook.


JOYCE
Look what I found! It's my old
yearbook, from junior year. Oh,
look, there I am.
Buffy looks for a second.

BUFFY
Mom, I accepted that you've had
sex. I'm not ready to know you've
had Farrah hair.
JOYCE
This is Gidget hair. Don't they
teach you anything in history?

BUFFY
That's cool. I gotta book --

JOYCE
Well I was thinking, I mean I know
the cheerleading thing didn't work
out. Maybe you should think about
joining the yearbook staff. I did
it, and it was a lot of fun.

BUFFY
Not really my tip, mom.

JOYCE
I was photo editor. I got to be on
every page. Made me look much more
popular than I was.

BUFFY
Have you seen the kids who do
yearbook, mom? Nerds pick on
them.

JOYCE
Some of the best times I had in
school were working on the
yearbook.

BUFFY
This just in: I'm not you. I'm
into my own thing.

JOYCE
Your own thing, whatever it is, got
you kicked out of school. And we
had to move here to find a decent
school that would take you.

Quite frankly, ouch. The sting hangs in the air before Buffy grabs her books and walks out.

JOYCE
Honey...
Joyce stands there a moment, upset with herself.

JOYCE
Great parenting form. Little shaky
on the dismount...
CUT TO:
EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

Cordelia, walking more slowly and regally than usual, passes Xander and Willow (pen in mouth).

XANDER
(to Cordelia)
Morning your Highness, beheadings
at noon as usual?
(to Willow, re:
Cordelia's departing
back).
Okay, see how she has now clue I'm
even a mammal, much less a human
being?
WILLOW
None.

XANDER
This invisible man syndrome, a
blessing in Cordelia's case, a
curse in Buffy's.

WILLOW
You're not invisible to Buffy.

XANDER
Worse, I'm just part of the
scenery, like an old shoe, or a rug
you walk on every day but you never
really see --

WILLOW
(trying to be helpful)
-- like a pen that's all chewed up
and you know you should throw it
away but you don't, not 'cause you
really like it that much but more
'cause you're just so used to it
and --

XANDER
Will. That is the point and let's
not drive it through my head like a
railroad spike. What I have do --
what I'm going to do -- is just
what you said --

WILLOW
Throw away the pen, forget about
Buffy.
(tosses pen in trash)

XANDER
What I have to do -- what I'm going
to do -- is be a man and ask her
out. No more i.d. bracelets, subtle
innuendo, or Polaroids outside her
bedroom window late at night --
that last is a joke to relieve the
tension because here she comes.

Buffy rounds a corner, heading their way.

WILLOW
I know I'm relieved.
XANDER
Alright. Into battle I go. would
you ask her out for me? No. Man.
Me. Battle.

ANGLE - BUFFY

Passing Cordelia at her locker. Buffy sees Cordelia reach for her combination -- her fingers miss it, find it. Buffy moves on, is intercepted by:

XANDER
Buffy, how would you like to...
BUFFY
(looking back)
Is that even Cordelia's locker?

XANDER
Huh? I don't know, what I'm saying
here is, accompany me Friday
night...

Buffy, not really listening, sees Cordelia give up on the locker which won't open for her, walk off.

BUFFY
Hang on, Xander, I have to... we
can pick this up later, you don't
mind, do you?
As she turns and goes. He watches her. A small high-pitched sound builds slowly in the back of his throat -- the sound of a plan going down, down, down.

XANDER
(explosion)
Pplllewww!
CUT TO:
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Cordelia, still moving more slowly than usual, makes her way across campus.

Buffy exits a building fifty yards or so behind Cordelia. Follows her, concerned.

EXT. DRIVER'S ED - DAY

Orange cones are set up in a little course on the blacktop. A DRIVER'S ED car, MR. POLE, the beleaguered TEACHER, two STUDENTS. Cordelia walks up.

MR. POLE
Nice of you to join us Cordelia. We
didn't keep you waiting or anything
did we? It's your turn to drive.
Let's buckle up, people.
Pole and students move to the car.

CORDELIA
I don't want to drive today, Mr.
Pole.
Mr. Pole looks wildly uncomfortable for a beat, then:

MR. POLE
You've flunked Driver's Ed twice -
show me some moves or you'll be
taking the bus to college.
Cordelia marches to the car, climbs behind the wheel.

ANGLE - BUFFY

Moving up, keeping an eye on Cordelia.

EXT.\INT. DRIVER'S ED CAR - DAY

Mr. Pole buckles up in the passenger seat.

MR. POLE
Check your brake, your mirrors,
start the engine, put the car in
drive...
ANGLE - CORDELIA

Tight on her face, looking at the

GEAR SHIFT INDICATOR

It's a big blur. This girl is having trouble seeing.

MR. POLE
...let' move forward and through
the cones in a gentle, even turn to
the --
Cordelia puts the car in REVERSE, steps on the gas. The car jerks backwards, knocking into a pole.

MR. POLE
-- brakes!
Cordelia slams on the brakes, jams the car through every gear until she finds drive, hits the gas.

The car SCREECHES forward.

MR. POLE
Slow down, turn right, right,
BRAKES, BRAKES!!
Cordelia does as she's told, yanking the wheel, stomping on the brakes.

Cordelia's car launches into a nasty skid, right off the blacktop, onto the grass, careening out of control now towards the street.

Buffy starts running like hell.

Mr. Pole and the KIDS IN BACK SCREAM bloody murder.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Cordelia's car skids into the street and stops. A car swerves around them, tires squealing, HORN BLARING.

MR. POLE
Everyone out!
Cordelia, Pole, the students scramble out. Mr. Pole and the students run. Cordelia looks around, completely disoriented.

CORDELIA'S POV

Dark and murky, dimmest shape of a UPS size truck bearing down on her. She takes a step away, then another -- in about five seconds she's going to be hamburger.

BUFFY

Tears across the grass onto the sidewalk.

CORDELIA
Screams, terrified, expecting the worst.

THE TRUCK

Hits its breaks, heading right at Cordelia.

BUFFY

Leaps on a parked car, using it as a booster to send her AIRBORNE.

BUFFY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, TACKLES CORDELIA

Carrying her out of harm's way as the truck screeches past.

CORDELIA AND BUFFY

On the ground.

CORDELIA
What's happening?!? I can't see
anything!
BUFFY
Cordelia, it's okay, you're gonna
be -- Oh, god...

Buffy looks at Cordelia whose EYES GLAZE OVER TO MURKY WHITE.

CORDELIA
What's happening to me!?!
CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

CLOSE ON GILES

GILES
Witchcraft. Blinding your enemy to
disable and disorient them is a
classic.
ANGLE - Buffy, Xander, Willow. Giles holds a witchcraft text. We see AN ENGRAVING of SCARY WITCHES in SACRED CIRCLE in the woods.

XANDER
First vampires, now witches... no
wonder you can still afford a house
in Sunnydale.
GILES
Why would someone want to harm
Cordelia?

WILLOW
Maybe because... they met her. Did
I say that?

GILES
Then why was Amber set ablaze?

XANDER
Yeah, those guys don't hang.

BUFFY
They're both cheerleaders.

GILES
Someone doesn't like cheerleading.

BUFFY
Or likes it too much.

WILLOW
Amy.

BUFFY
Amy.

XANDER
So you guys are leaning towards
Amy.

BUFFY
She's desperate to get on that
team... I get the feeling she'd do
anything to make her mom's dream
come true.

GILES
Now I do want to make sure I've got
this right. This witch is casting
horrible, disfiguring spells so
that she can be a cheerleader.

BUFFY
Your point being?

GILES
Priorities. Really, if I had the
power of the black mass I'd set my
sights a little higher than making
the pep squad.

BUFFY
I think you're underestimating the
amount of pressure a parent can lay
on you. If you're not a picture
perfect carbon copy they tend to
wig.

WILLOW
Cheerleading was kind of her mom's
last hurrah.

XANDER
We still gotta stop Amy. We should
grab her before --

GILES
(flipping though text)
Let's be certain she's the witch
before we arouse her suspicions.
She's capable of some fairly ugly
things.

BUFFY
All right, you're a high school
girl, you're desperate to make the
team and please your mom, you turn
to witchcraft. What's the first
thing you do?

WILLOW
check out the books on witchcraft!

Willow moves to the computer at check-out desk, scanning records.

XANDER
That's the last thing you do! You
don't leave a paper trail. Forget
that --
WILLOW
It'll just take a minute --

XANDER
We don't have a minute.
Cheerleaders' lives are in
danger -- Buffy's in danger.
(grabs Buffy, tries to
hustle her out)
You were the first alternate.
You're on the team now that
Cordelia's out -- you could be
next, we have to get you to a safe
house.

WILLOW
(sees something on
computer)
Xander...

XANDER
(innocent)
Yes?

WILLOW
"Witches - Historic Roots to Modern
Practice" checked out by Alexander
Harris.

BUFFY
(moves to computer)
"The Pagan Rites", checked out by
Alexander --

XANDER
All right, all right. It's not
what you think.

WILLOW
You like to look at the semi-nude
engravings?

XANDER
Oh. Well, then it is what you
think.

GILES
We'll need a conclusive test
anyway. There should be one - yes!
The ducking stool. We throw her in
the pond. If she floats, she's a
witch; if she drowns, she's
innocent.
(off their looks)
... some of my texts are a bit
outdated.

BUFFY
You think?

GILES
(looks in another book)
Ah! Yes. This should work.
You'll need some of her hair, a
little quicksilver and aqua fortis.

WILLOW
That's just mercury and nitric
acid, we can get it in the science
lab.

GILES
(reads)
"Heat ingredients and apply to
witch, if a spell has been cast in
previous forty-eight hours witch's
skin will turn blue." Oh, and
you'll need some eye of newt.

SMASH CUT TO:
A FROG - INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY

His big ol' eye looking up at us.

PULL BACK, revealing we are seeing this in a BIG MIRROR, mounted on the teacher's desk in front of the class. The mirror is so the students can see what DR. GREGORY (kindly, older) is doing. willow, Xander, Buffy, Lishanne and Amy are part of the class.

DR. GREGORY
Those on track one may begin their
dissections. Those on track two,
add your hydrochloric acid and
ammonium hydroxide to your
beakers...
He demonstrates, we see it in the big mirror. Smoke and gas. He holds up the smoky beaker.

ANGLE - WILLOW AND XANDER

At a large table. Xander holds a scalpel poised over a frog. He lowers the scalpel, then:

XANDER
I can't.
He puts the scalpel down. Willow takes it, makes (off camera) a quick neat incision.

WILLOW
One eye of newt...
XANDER
Wow, you've got a killer streak
I've never seen before. Hope I
never cross you.

WILLOW
I do too, then I'd have to carve
you up in neat little pieces.

She holds up the scalpel, gives him her sweet "Willow" smile.

XANDER
Ha ha.
(takes scalpel
respectfully)
How's Buffy coming with the hair?
ANGLE: BUFFY

Moving past Lishanne.

LISHANNE
(sarcastically)
Isn't this exciting?
BUFFY
(small laugh)
Oh yeah.

Buffy reaches Amy at another big desk with Bunsen burner, beakers, etc.

BUFFY
Help. Which is the hydrochloric
acid and which is the ammonium
hydroxide?
AMY
Well, the bottle that says
hydrochloric acid is usually the
hydrochloric acid.

BUFFY
Read the bottles -- what a concept.

Buffy drops her pen, bends down to pick it up, as she does, her hand slips INSIDE AMY'S purse, grabs some hair off Amy's brush.

ANGLE - BUFFY STRAIGHTENS UP

Amy's looking at her -- did she see the hair grab?

Buffy moves back to her seat (in front of Willow and Xander.) Keeping her back to them, she reaches back, drops the hair in front of Willow who adds it to a chemical mix on a Bunsen burner.

Amy glances at them.

XANDER
(through his teeth)
Smile and wave to the nice witch.
Willow hands the beaker to Buffy.

WILLOW
All set. You have a plan?
BUFFY
Spill it on her, try and make it
look natural.

XANDER
We'll be right behind you. Only
farther away.

Buffy heads for Amy's desk with beaker. As she does,

DR. GREGORY
Lishanne, can you tell me why these
chemicals have this reaction?
Buffy casually spills a drops or two on Amy's arm. Buffy looks at:

ANGLE - AMY'S ARM

The drops do turn blue, but we tilt up to see Amy's eyes locked on someone else.

ANGLE - LISHANNE

We see her from behind, starting to shake, to spaz out.

DR. GREGORY
Lishanne? Are you -- Oh my god.
She knocks a few beakers over as she stumblingly rises and turns, grabbing at the first thing she sees -- which is Amy. Amy is brought face to face with Lishanne -- WHO HAS NO MOUTH. Amy backs away, terrified by what she sees.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Our three are clustered, conferring.

XANDER
Did you see? Amy was as freaked
out as the rest of us.
WILLOW
So it's not her?

BUFFY
The test was positive. She's our
Sabrina. I just don't think she
realizes what she's doing.

WILLOW
Should we talk to her?

BUFFY
Maybe we should talk to her
mother. I wonder if she knows
what she's created.

CUT TO:
EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY

Pushing in on the house as Amy enters frame, marches up and through the front door.

INT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY

Dark. Austere. Clean. Amy moves through, pissed. We haven't seen her like this before.

AMY
Where are you?!
Amy finds her mother, CATHERINE MADISON, late thirties, very well preserved, sitting in the blue light of the T.V. Catherine quickly flicks the T.V. off, like a kid caught doing something wrong.

AMY
Another productive day in front of
the T.V. I got a history report due
tomorrow. Write it.
Amy hurls her book bag on the couch next to her mother.

AMY
I should be on that team by now.
Instead, Miss Buffy and friends are
sneaking around stealing bits of my
hair.
CLOSE - AMY'S HAND

As she angrily dangles something from it -- the i.d. bracelet Xander gave Buffy. We're close enough to read "Yours Always".

AMY
I'll be upstairs.
Amy wraps her fingers around Buffy's bracelet, marches out.

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT TWO
Act Three
INT. BUFFY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

We TRACK IN on Buffy sleeping.

ANGLE: ALARM CLOCK

It's one of the old fashioned round ones with the bell, and it starts RINGING.

Buffy lumps around under the cover, mewling in protest before she reaches for the clock.

She grabs it and casually CRUSHES it with her hand. Poles her head out from under the covers to look at what she has wrought.


BUFFY
(laughs)
Oops.
CUT TO:
INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN A BIT LATER

Joyce is making breakfast. Buffy comes in in a really good mood.

BUFFY
(sings to herself)
MACHO MACHO MAN... Hey, juice.
She downs an entire glass in one sip.

BUFFY
Quality juice. Not from
concentrate.
JOYCE
(tentatively)
You're in a good mood.

BUFFY
I am. I'm on the squad. Which is
great because I feel like cheering.
And leading others to cheer. Hey,
juice!

She downs Joyce's as well.

JOYCE
Listen honey, about yesterday...
BUFFY
That's totally yester. Besides,
it's not like you were wrong. I
did get kicked out. I'm wacky that
way.

JOYCE
Still, I want you to know that
despite the problems you've had --

BUFFY
Mom, you don't get it. Believe me,
you don't want it. There's just
things about being a vampire slayer
that the older generation has a
problem with.

JOYCE
A what?

BUFFY
Long story. I mean I'm kidding.

JOYCE
Buffy, are you feeling well?

BUFFY
I can't be in a good mood? That's
a new house rule? Fine, I don't
mind, cuz I'm a
(sings)
MACHO MACHO MAN...

She sings her way out, leaving Joyce somewhat worried.

EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING

BUFFY (O.S.)
Turn up the music!
INT. THE GYM - DAY

The cheerleaders -- Buffy, Senior Cheerleader and the rest practice. Buffy has a big, happy grin on her face, she's workin' this cheer -- unfortunately she's workin' it completely out of sync with everyone else.

Buffy stomps on the Senior Cheerleader's foot.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Ow! Get it together, Buffy, we have
a game in less than four hours.
ANGLE - DOOR

Willow and Xander slip in to watch.

BUFFY
(yells)
Hey Willow, Xander! My buds are
here. I love my buds.
WILLOW AND XANDER

React to Buffy.

XANDER
Is it me, or is Buffy somewhat
looped?
Each girl launches the one next to her into a spinning cartwheel. Buffy is launched.

WILLOW AND XANDER

WILLOW
We better get her out of there.
XANDER
Yeah, before she...

Buffy cartwheels to the Senior Cheerleader, grabs her and HURLS HER OUT OF FRAME like a flying sack of potatoes.

WILLOW AND XANDER WINCE

XANDER
....hurts somebody.
ANGLE - SENIOR CHEERLEADER

Splatted in the corner of the gym where she landed. She gets up, way more angry than hurt.

BUFFY
Did I do that?
SENIOR CHEERLEADER
You are so out of here!

Willow and Xander rush in, grab Buffy.

WILLOW
It's not her fault --
XANDER
She's on medication --

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Obviously not enough. Who's our
next alternate -- oh.

Amy is right there, in costume.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Amy, you just made cheerleader.
BUFFY
No no no, you don't want her, she's
a wi--

Xander clamps a hand over Buffy's mouth as Willow and he hustle her out.

XANDER
A wise choice indeed.
As Amy stands, innocently joins the line,

CUT TO:
INT. GYM FOYER: DAY

Willow and Xander drag Buffy out, shut the door.

BUFFY
She's a witchy!!
WILLOW
Buffy --

BUFFY
I just got kicked off the team,
didn't I?

XANDER
I don't think it's your fault.

BUFFY
I know you don't. That's cause
you're my friend. You're my
Xander-shaped friend.
(wells up)
...do you have any idea why I love
you so, Xander?

WILLOW
We gotta get you to --

XANDER
Let her speak!

BUFFY
I'll tell you. You're not like
other guys at all...

XANDER
Well...

BUFFY
You are completely and totally one
of the girls. I'm that comfy with
you.

Willow can't help but look a little pleased; Xander looks like he just got cancer.

XANDER
That's great.
BUFFY
Any other guy gave me a bracelet,
they'd want to date me, it'd be a
thing, but you -- you --

She staggers a bit.

BUFFY
Oh. I don't feel so good.
She slumps over, pale and sweaty.

WILLOW
Buffy?
BUFFY
Something is really... not good...

She collapses in their arms.

CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - GILES' OFFICE - DAY

Buffy's laid out in two easy chairs. A cold compress on her head. She's conscious but very sick. Giles (ever present text in hand) Willow and Xander stand over her, concerned.

WILLOW
We gotta get her to a hospital.
GILES
They can't help her. This is a
Bloodstone Vengeance Spell, hits
the body hard, like drinking a
quart of alcohol, then eradicates
the immune system.

XANDER
Vengeance spell. Like she's getting
even with Buffy?

BUFFY
(weak)
'Cause she knows I know she's a
witch.

GILES
The others she just wanted out of
the running, you she intends to...

BUFFY
Kill.

WILLOW
How much time do we have?

GILES
I'm sure we have --

BUFFY
Truth please.

GILES
Couple of hours, three at most.

XANDER
So how do we reverse Buffy's spell?

GILES
I've been researching that. We can
reverse all the spells if we can
get our hands on Amy's spell
book --

WILLOW
And if we can't get our hands on
it?

GILES
The only other way is to cut the
witch's head off.

XANDER
(raising his hand)
Show of hands...

BUFFY
No. It's not Amy's fault. She
became a witch to survive her
mother.

XANDER
I don't care why, I care that you
go on breathing.

BUFFY
Giles, where would she be casting
these spells?

GILES
She needs a sacred space with a
pentagram, a large pot...

BUFFY
At home. Help me get up.
(Giles helps her up)
We'll go to her house, find her
book --

WILLOW
We'll go with you.

BUFFY
No. Stay here, keep an eye on Amy.

GILES
And keep her away from the science
lab. We'll need it to cast our
counter spells.

CUT TO:
EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Giles pulls up.

ANGLE: THE DOOR

He knocks loudly. Buffy peeks in the window by the door.

ANGLE: THROUGH THE WINDOW - AMY'S LIVING ROOM

We see Catherine start at the sound of knocking. She takes something we can't see very well and slides it under the coffee table. Comes anxiously to the door.

It opens, and she stands before Buffy and Giles. It's clear from the expression on Buffy's face that this isn't what she was expecting.

CATHERINE
What do you want? Is there
something wrong?
GILES
Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to
you about your daughter.

CATHERINE
I'm not allowed to -- you'll have
to come back.

she tries to shut the door -- he pushes it open rather forcefully. He ushers Buffy in.

CUT TO:
INT. AMY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Giles moves Buffy to the couch, turns to Catherine.

GILES
Your daughter is up to something
very dangerous. Are you aware of
that?
CATHERINE
I don't know what you're talking
about.

GILES
I think you know very well.

CATHERINE
You have to go. She's gonna be
home soon.

GILES
This girl is very sick. You will
shut up and you will listen to me.
You daughter has access to some
very powerful magics. Somehow
your obsession with cheerleading has
made her --

CATHERINE
(near tears)
I don't care about cheerleading!
It's not my fault she's doing
stuff.

Buff is staring intently at Catherine.

GILES
As her mother, you should accept
some responsibility for her
actions.
Surprisingly, she starts laughing.

CATHERINE
Well, these kids today...
Buffy looks at her, then looks at what Amy hid under the table.

ANGLE: UNDER THE TABLE

is a plate of brownies.

Buffy stands, weakly.

CATHERINE
She's out of her mind. Ever since
control her.
GILES
You're afraid of her.

She turns to look at Buffy, who approaches her slowly. Giles turns as well.

BUFFY
Amy?
Catherine takes a step back, wide eyed.

BUFFY
Are you Amy?
GILES
I don't understand...

BUFFY
She switched, didn't she? She
switched your bodies. She wanted
to relive her glory days.
Catherine the Great.

GILES
Good lord...

Catherine nods, quietly.

CATHERINE
She said I was wasting my youth...
So she took it.
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT THREE
Act Four
INT. AMY'S LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Catherine has sat down on the couch next to Buffy. She is terrified and fighting back tears.


CATHERINE
I didn't know about her... her
power. When my dad was here they
would fight, he called her a witch.
I thought he meant something else.
When he left I wanted to go with
him but she wouldn't even let me
call. She got crazy. She'd lock
herself upstairs for days. And
she'd get down on me all the time.
She said I didn't deserve to have
it so easy, that I didn't know how
hard it was to be her. I guess she
showed me, huh?
She does cry now, quietly. It takes all of Buffy's effort to say:

BUFFY
Amy, it's gonna be okay.
CATHERINE
A few months ago I woke up in her
bed, I didn't know where I was...
and I looked in the mirror...

GILES
She locked herself upstairs.
Where?

CATHERINE
She has a room in the attic.

GILES
Show me.

CUT TO:
INT. AMY'S ATTIC - A BIT LATER

We see the dolls lined up in the foreground as in the background the DOOR BURSTS OPEN, Giles coming in behind it.

Catherine stays in the doorway, too afraid to enter as Giles comes up to the dolls.

CATHERINE
If she finds out I've been in here
she'll kill me.
GILES
My God...

ANGLE: TWO DOLLS

A woman and a girl. The dolls are lashed together with a thorny vine.

GILES
I believe we can reverse your
mother's spell. All of them, in
fact.
CATHERINE
You really could?

GILES
Yes, but I need her books. There
are certain volumes she would need
for this kind of casting.

He looks around. Tentatively, she enters, and helps. They rummage about in the dark recesses of the place, looking on shelves, under old blankets.

Giles discovers a small trunk. As he pulls it open he says to Catherine:

GILES
Collect those dolls, and all the
personal --
something LEAPS at him from the trunk, SCREECHING -- a black cat. Giles jumps back as the cat hits the floor and takes off out of the room.

Giles takes a moment to recover himself.

GILES
Nice kitty...
(looking in the trunk)
What were you guarding? Yes...
He pulls out the book.

GILES
This is it.
INT. AMY'S LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Giles comes back down with the book, Catherine with the box of talismans.

Buffy is back on the couch. She looks ghastly, but she looks up to Giles with hope.

BUFFY
Did we find?
GILES
We found.

He gently helps her to her feet. He hands the book to Catherine and picks Buffy up.

CATHERINE
Where are you going?
GILES
We're going to school. And you're
coming with us.

CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - EVENING

We hear students CHEERING as the school basketball team takes the floor.

The camera is in steady motion, following the team, sweeping across the stands, racing by the cheerleaders. The last one is Amy.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - EVENING

They enter, Giles placing Buffy in a chair as Catherine drops the box on a table. He squats before Buffy, looks her in the eyes.

GILES
I'm going to stop this.
ANGLE: BUFFY'S POV

the figure of Giles is a colorful BLUR. The room seems to teeter and shift around him, his VOICE a bizarre and deep echo.

GILES
I promise. Just hang on.
He stands up (we are no longer in her POV), digs in the box for the book.

CATHERINE
How is she?
GILES
We only have a few minutes.

Giles pulls the book out of the box, starts looking through it.

GILES
Let's see... I'll need lead,
sulphur, some sort of diacetate...
He goes over to the glass cabinet with the chemicals in it. It's locked. Casually, still looking down at the book for reference, he picks up a metal beaker and smashes the glass. He looks in and starts picking out vials of useful substances.

CATHERINE
What should I do?
He turns to her.

GILES
Find me a frog.
CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

The game has started, the kids in the stands CHEERING. The cheerleaders are on the sideline, doing steps.

ANGLE: AMY

Is right there with them, last on the left. She is beaming.

ANGLE: THE CROWD - AMY'S POV

They are a ROARING mass, an appreciative audience. A joyful noise.

And she moves in SLOW MOTION, the camera circling LOW around her, as she relives her greatest glory.

ANGLE: THE STANDS

The camera whips across the fans to find Xander and Willow up off to the side.

They alone are silent, their eyes never leaving Amy.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - A BIT LATER

Giles has something bubbling in a beaker, a Bunsen burner under it.

Catherine is nearby, reluctantly prying out a dead frog's eyes.

GILES
Right.
He throws in a powder, and begins:

GILES
(reading)
The center is dark.
(in Latin)
centrum est obscurus.
(reading)
The darkness breathes.
(in Latin)
tenebrae respiratis.
(reading)
The listener hears.
He throws in another powder.

GILES
Hear me.
CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

Amy is still strutting in step, still basking in her glory.

ANGLE: AMY'S POV

The appreciative crowd is before us, and then suddenly it becomes

ANGLE: CATHERINE'S POV

the lab. A table. A frog.

It's just a flash, and then it's the audience again. Amy starts, wide eyed, and nearly messes up.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Catherine is reeling just as Amy was, shaking off the momentary change.

CATHERINE
It's working...
GILES
(reading)
Unlock the gate, let the darkness
shine. Cover us with holy fear.
Show me.

He barks the order again, "show me", but this time in Arabic (waar re-nee).

The lights in the room blow out.

CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

The cheerleaders are forming a pyramid, Amy at the top. She is up there when:

ANGLE: CATHERINE'S POV

flashes before us again. This time it's clearer; we can see Giles, and the whole room. Our gaze sweeps over to include the dying Buffy.

Amy SCREAMS -- and falls, wrecking the whole pyramid. The girls tumble about, the fans LAUGHING a bit.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Amy, what's your problem?
Amy stands, primal fury on her face. The cheerleader backs off.

 

Amy RUNS out of the gym.

ANGLE: XANDER AND WILLOW

They see her go.

WILLOW
She must be heading for Buffy!
XANDER
Come on.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE: BUFFY'S POV

Giles continues the spell, in Buffy's increasingly weird, dark view. His voice is not even human to her anymore.

ANGLE: CATHERINE

She is still reeling from the flashes. She looks up suddenly.

CATHERINE
She's heading this way.
CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL HALL - CONTINUOUS

Amy turns a corner and runs smack into a very casual Willow.

WILLOW
Amy!
AMY
Get out of my way!

WILLOW
Wait! I needed to talk to you. I
can help you.

The look Amy gives her raises one's hair.

AMY
Help me? With what?
WILLOW
Well, you know, all your...
witchcraft. I know a really
good... cauldron... do you actually
ride a broom or --

Xander is sneaking up behind Amy. She SPINS suddenly and glares at him. She mutters something under her breath and he stops, suddenly unable to breathe. Drops to his knees.

WILLOW
Xander!
Amy turns and PUNCHES Willow, knocks her to the ground.

Amy takes off.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Things are really heating up in here. Giles holds his hands to the heavens:

GILES
Corsheth, and Gilail, the gate is
closed. Receive the dark, release
the unworthy... Take of mine
energy and be sated!
He PLUNGES HIS HANDS into the brew! Huge colored cloud shoots up.

INTERCUT WITH:
INT. HALL OUTSIDE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Amy arrives, tries the door.

Catherine sees the door rattle, startles back in terror

ANGLE: AMY

Smashes the emergency glass and pulls out an axe.

ANGLE: GILES

Pulls his dripping hands out.

GILES
Be sated! Release the unworthy!
ANGLE: THE AXE

hits the door, burying itself above the lock.

ANGLE: GILES

GILES
Release!
ANGLE: BUFFY

Her eyes flutter shut, her head slumping over.

GILES
Release!
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

And the door BURSTS OPEN, An axe wielding Amy running in. She takes one quick look around, heads for Buffy --

GILES
RELEASE!
Amy raises the axe -- there is a flash of light --
--and she stops. Lowers it as

ANGLE: BUFFY

stands, completely restored. She and Amy look at each other in wonder.

BUFFY
Amy?
And Catherine FLIES into frame, SCREAMING and tackling Buffy. The woman has gone completely apeshit. Giles comes at her and she just LOOKS up at him --

-- and a desk MOVES at him, knocking him down.

Catherine stands, comes toward the cowering Amy. Nothing but hate in her gaze.

CATHERINE
You. You little brat.
AMY
Mom, please...

She is retreating, raising the axe more for protection than anything else. Catherine merely cocks her head and the axe FLIES out of Amy's hand and into her own. Amy stifles a scream.

CATHERINE
Raise a hand to your own mother?
Who gave you birth, who gave up her
life, her LIFE so you could drag
your worthless carcass around and
call it living?
She SLAMS the axe into a table top.

Amy looks from the axe to her mother.

ANGLE: CATHERINE'S HANDS

Something is happening -- energy begins emanating from them -- like sparks, only black. Something very powerful is brewing in her.

CATHERINE
You were never anything but
trouble. I'll put you where you'll
never make trouble again.
Buffy appears right behind Catherine.

BUFFY
Hey, guess what?
Catherine turns.

BUFFY
I feel better.
ANGLE: Catherine flies over a table, hits the ground with all attendant smashing of glass things.

Buffy comes around the table and Catherine pops back up, wired with fury.

CATHERINE
That body was mine! Mine!
BUFFY
Oh, grow up.

Catherine throws her head back in a mystical shriek --- and Buffy is flung back over the teacher's desk. She rises to see Catherine shaking, about to cast the spell.

CATHERINE
I shall look upon my enemy --
Her arms CRACKLE with energy -- she opens her eyes and they are glowing darkly- she throws her arms forward with the final phrase --

CATHERINE
-- I shall look upon her and the
dark place will have her soul!
Corsheth! Take her!
And Buffy SWINGS her leg over the table and BREAKS the support for the mirror above -- it comes down, hitting the table at an angle, still supported on the other side.

It's too late for Catherine to stop. The spell shoots out of her arms at her own reflection. It bounces right back at her.

She SCREAMS. Glows. Energy singing around her, wrapping her up.

Then there's nothing.

Giles, no longer pinned, gets up, creeps forward with Amy. Buffy comes from behind the desk. They all look around them, but they are alone. After a while...

GILES
Well, that was interesting.
BUFFY
Are you guys okay?

AMY
(feelingly)
I'm fine.

Buffy smiles at her.

GILES
I think all the spells were
reversed. Of course, it's my first
casting, I may have got it wrong.
BUFFY
You save my life. You were a god.

GILES
One doesn't want to be immodest,
but I am not unsatisfied --

BUFFY
Giles, stop being so proper.
You're in America. Brag.

And they head for the door, Giles obliging:

GILES
Well, it was the first time and some of
those incantations are quite
tricky. And I was somewhat
interpretive with the
ingredients --
A FIGURE LEAPS OUT at Amy, tackles her.

It's Xander.

XANDER
I got her! I got her! Cut her
head off!
BUFFY
Xander, what are you doing?

XANDER
Saving you.

Buffy pulls him off Amy.

XANDER
But she's evil!
GILES
Well, it wasn't exactly her.

AMY
It was my mom.

XANDER
Oh.

It takes a moment for him to realize he has no idea what they're talking about. Willow runs in now, carrying a baseball bat.

WILLOW
Where is she?
XANDER
Willow! It's cool.

WILLOW
It is?

XANDER
Oh yeah. I took care of it.

CUT TO:
INT. BUFFY'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Buffy is throwing pieces of her alarm clock in the trash when Joyce enters.

JOYCE
I don't get it.
BUFFY
What?

JOYCE
I've been thinking a lot about
where you're coming from, how to
relate to you, and I've come to a
simple conclusion. I don't get it.
What you want, what you're
thinking. Not a clue.

BUFFY
I'm inscrutable, huh?

JOYCE
You're sixteen. I think there's a
biological imperative whereby I
can't understand you because I'm
not sixteen.

BUFFY
Do you ever wish you could be?
Sixteen again?

JOYCE
There's a frightful notion. Go
through all that again.
(shudders)
No even if it helped me understand
you.

Buffy kisses her on the cheek --

BUFFY
I love you, mom.
-- and exit, leaving Joyce thrown once more.

JOYCE
I don't get it.
CUT TO:
INT. HALL BY THE GYM - DAY (DAYS LATER)

Buffy and Amy are walking through the hall.

AMY
Dad is so impossible. He doesn't
ever want me going anywhere, wants
to spend total quality time
together.
I'm like, "Dad, I can go out, it's
perfectly safe." He's got all this
guilt at leaving me with mom and
he's being a total pain.
BUFFY
You're loving it.

AMY
Every single minute.

Cordelia breezes by with the other cheerleaders as they get out of the gym. We see Amber and Lishanne -- all recovered.

CORDELIA
Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got
bumped back to alternate. Hold
it -- wait -- no I'm not.
AMY
Well, I know I'll miss the
intellectual thrill of spelling
words out with my arms.

CORDELIA
Ooh, these grapes are sour.

She exits, passing Buffy, who is staring at the trophy case. Amy looks to her, the smile leaving her face.

AMY
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you
actually wanted to be on the squad.
BUFFY
No, that's okay. Cheerleading is
just a little too hairy these days.

AMY
That's for sure.

For a moment they both look at Catherine's trophy.

AMY
Catherine the Great.
BUFFY
And there's been no sign of her?

AMY
That last spell, she said I'd never
make trouble again. Wherever she
is, I don't think we have to worry.

BUFFY
Twisted.

AMY
I'm just happy to have my body
back.
(as they walk off)
I'm thinking of getting fat.

BUFFY
Well, that look is in for spring.

As they leave, we stay on the trophy. TRACK in closer to the cheerleading figure on top. And closer, to the impassive bronze face.

Her eyes dart back and forth.

BLACK OUT.
END OF SHOW
