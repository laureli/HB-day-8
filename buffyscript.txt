FADE IN:

EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL – NIGHT

The front of the affluent Southern California school gleams darkly in the moonlight.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – CONTINUOUS

TRACK through the hall. Nothing.

CUT TO:
INT. CLASSROOM – CONTINUOUS

Silent.

We track along the wall, past the maps and drawings tacked up on it, past the window, which SHATTERS in our faces!

It’s just a single pane, knocked in by someone’s hand. It unlocks the window and slides it up.

The intrude is a college age BOY, a timid GIRL beside him. She looks about nervously.

GIRL
Are you sure this is a good idea?
BOY
It’s a great idea! Come on.

As they climb in.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – A MOMENT LATER

He leads her out here. It’s even darker than the classroom

GIRL
You go to school here?
BOY
Used to.
On top of the gym, it’s so cool – you can see the whole town.

GIRL
I don’t want to go up there.

BOY
Oh, you can’t wait, huh?

He moves to kiss her.

GIRL
We’re just gonna get in trouble
BOY
Count on it.

He kisses her, but she turns suddenly, real fear crossing her face.

GIRL
What was that?
BOY
What was what?

GIRL
I heard a noise.

BOY
It’s nothing.

GIRL
Maybe it’s something…

BOY
Maybe it’s some Thing...

GIRL
That’s not funny.

He looks about them. The place is dark, shadowy. She cowers behind him.

BOY
Hello…?
Silence.

BOY
There’s nobody here.
GIRL
Are you sure?

BOY
I’m sure.

GIRL
Okay…

She bares HORRIBLE FANGS and BURIES them in his neck.

BLACKOUT.
END OF TEASER
CREDITS

Act One
EXT. NIGHT – AN ALLEY (THE DREAM)
CLOSE UP: SHOES

A poor man’s shoes, walking down the alley. Echoing in the emptiness.

ANGLE: THE MAN

Walking tentatively, far away. Suddenly the camera RUSHES at him like a predator – he turns just as it reaches him and –

ANGLE: A CANDLE BLOWING OUT.

We HEAR CHILDREN CHANTING a schoolyard song eerily in the blackness, on top of sinister WHISPERS, and we see

ANGLE: THE ALLEY

And the man, face down, unable to crawl, clawing his way along the ground in terror – and his body is YANKED out of frame with incredible speed.

ANGLE: A GIRL IN BED

Tossing and turning, as the camera moves down to reveal the shadow of someone – something – approaching her – and we hear an impossibly low voice:

VOICE (O.S.)
I’ll take you… like a cancer…
I’ll get inside you and eat my way out…
ANGLE: A POOL OF BLOOD

ANGLE: A DEMONIC FACE

ROARS out of the shadows and we

CUT TO:
INT. BUFFY’S BEDROOM – MORNING

Her eyes snap open. Despite the morning light, we recognize the girl – and the bed – from the dream. A moment, as she gets her bearings, shakes off the immediacy of the dream.

BUFFY’S MOM (O.S.)
Buffy…
BUFFY
I’m up, mom.

BUFFY’S MOM (O.S.)
Don’t want to be late for your first day.

BUFFY
(to herself)
No… wouldn’t want that…

Her voice betrays her uncertainty. She sits up. A wider angle on her room reveals that it’s only half decorated: there are still boxes as yet unpacked in the corner.

CUT TO:
EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL – MORNING

A day as bright and colorful as the night was black and eerie. Students pour in before first bell, talking, laughing. They could be from anywhere in America, but for the extremity of their dress and the esoteric mania of their slang. This is definitely So Cal.

ANGLE: A CAR

Pulls up outside the school. Buffy’s mom, JOYCE, is driving. Buffy gets out the passenger side.

JOYCE
Now, you have a good time. I know you’ll make friends right away.
Think positive. And honey… try not to get kicked out.
BUFFY
I promise.

The girl turns, looks at the school. She starts in as her mother drives away.

ANGLE: A SKATEBOARD

Weaving along the road. On it is XANDER, dressed with the shaggy indifference common to skateboarders.

He is bright, funny, and will one day be suave and handsome. Till that day arrives, he’ll do the best he can with bright and funny.

He weaves through a thickening mass of students toward the school.

XANDER
Coming through… Coming through…
(as the crowd increases)
Not certain how to stop…
But he’s doing okay until he passes Buffy – intrigued by the new face, he cranes to look at her, and nearly takes a header. He saves himself from falling, however, coming to a stop just in front of:

WILLOW. She is shy, bookish, and very possibly dressed by her mother. The intelligence in her eyes and the sweetness of her smile belie a genuine charm that is lost on the unsubtle high school mind. It’s certainly lost on Xander, though he brightens considerably to see her. The new face forgotten, at least for now.

XANDER
Willow! You’re so much the person I wanted to see.
Her excitement at the sentiment is sweetly pathetic, and typically unnoticed.

WILLOW
Really?
XANDER
Yeah. You know, I kind of had a problem with the math.

WILLOW
(hiding disappointment)
Which part?

XANDER
The math. Can you help me tonight?
Please? Be my study buddy?

WILLOW
Well, what’s in it for me?

XANDER
A shiny nickel…

WILLOW
Okay. Do you have “Theories in Trig?” You should check it out.

XANDER
Check it out?

WILLOW
From the library. Where the books live.

XANDER
Right. I’m there. See, I want to change.

INT. SCHOOL HALL – CONTINUOUS

They are approached by JESSE, their bud. He is a little more awkward than Xander, a little less likely to become a lady killer in his later years.

JESSE
Hey.
XANDER
Jesse! What’s what.

JESSE
New girl!

XANDER
That’s right, I saw her. She’s pretty much a hotty.

WILLOW
I heard someone was transferring here.

XANDER
So. Tell.

JESSE
Tell what?

XANDER
What’s the sitch? What do you know about her?

JESSE
(“that’s all”)
New girl.

XANDER
Well, you’re certainly a font of nothing.

CUT TO:
INT. BOB FLUTIE’S OFFICE – CONTINUOUS

Buffy sits before principal FLUTIE. He is middle aged, a tad officious. Caught between the old school of strict discipline and the new school of sensitivity.

He pulls her transcript from a folder. He looks at it, looks at her.

MR FLUTIE
Buffy Summers. Sophomore, late of Hemery High in Los Angeles.
Interesting record. Quite a career.
He smiles, and carefully tears up her transcript up into four pieces.

MR FLUTIE
Welcome to Sunnydale. A clean slate, Buffy, that’s what you get here. What’s past is past.
We’re not interested in what it says on a piece of paper.
Even if it says
(looks down at a piece, reacts)
-- whoa. At Sunnydale we nurture the whole student. The inner student.
He is taking the pieces of the transcript as he talks and carefully placing them together again.

MR FLUTIE
Other schools might looks at the incredible decline in grade point average – we look at the
struggling young woman with the incredible decline in grade point average. Other schools might
look at the reports of gang fights –
BUFFY
Mr. Flutie –

MR FLUTIE
All the kids here are free to call me Bob –

BUFFY
Bob –

MR FLUTIE
--but they don’t.

He pulls out a piece of tape, starts taping the transcript back together.

BUFFY
Mr. Flutie. I know my transcripts are a little colorful –
MR FLUTIE
Hey, we’re not caring about that! Do you think “colorful” is the word? Not “dismal”? Just off
hand, I’d go with “dismal.”

BUFFY
It wasn’t that bad.

MR FLUTIE
You burned down the gym.

BUFFY
I did. I really did. But you gotta see the big picture. I mean, the gym was full of vamp… uh,
asbestos.

MR FLUTIE
Buffy. Don’t worry. Any other school, they might say “watch your step”, or, “we’ll be watching
you” or, “get within a hundred yards of the gym with a book of matches and you’ll grow up in
juvie hall” but that’s just not the way here. We want to service your needs, and help you to
respect our needs. And if you needs and our needs don’t mesh…

Still smiling blandly, he slips the taped up transcript back in her folder.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – A MOMENT LATER

Buffy exits to office, looking a bit depressed. She starts rummaging through her bag and a student runs by, bumps into her. Her books and stuff spill out. Frustrated, she kneels down, starts scooping it back in.

Xander sees this, goes up to her, kneeling.

XANDER
Can I have you? Dyeh – can I help you?
BUFFY
Oh, thanks…

He starts picking things up, handing them to her.

XANDER
I don’t know you, do I?
BUFFY
I’m new. I’m Buffy.

XANDER
Xander. Is me. Hi.

BUFFY
Thanks.

XANDER
Maybe I’ll see you around. Maybe at school, since we both… go there…

BUFFY
Great. Nice to meet you.

He gives her the rest of her books. She stuffs it all in her bag and hurries away.

XANDER
“We both go to school…” Very suave. Very not pathetic.
He notices something on the floor, bends down to get it. Calls after her:

XANDER
Oh, hey, you forgot your…
(looks at the thing in his hand)
…stake…
But she’s too far off to hear. He looks at the wooden stake, puzzled.

CUT TO:
INT. HISTORY CLASS – MORNING

THE TEACHER is in front, lecturing. We hear her mostly in voice over as we see Buffy near the back, earnestly taking notes. Trying to keep up.

TEACHER
It’s estimated that about 25 million people died in that one four year span. But the fun part of the
Black Plague is that it originated in Europe how? As an early form of germ warfare. The plague
was first found in Asia, and a Kipchak army actually catapulted plague-infested corpses into a 
Genoese trading post. Ingenious. If you look at the map on page 63 you can trace the spread of
the disease…
Buffy looks about as kids open their books – she hasn’t got one. The girl next to her, CORDELIA, leans over. She is pretty, self assured. Killer outfit.

CORDELIA
Here.
She moves her book over so Buffy can read off it as well.

BUFFY
Thanks.
TEACHER
And this popular plague led to what social changes?

CUT TO:
INT. SAME – END OF CLASS

Kids are piling up their books and leaving as the bell RINGS. Cordelia introduces herself:

CORDELIA
Hi, I’m Cordelia.
BUFFY
I’m Buffy.

CORDELIA
If you’re looking for a textbook of your very own, there’s probably a few in the Library.

BUFFY
Oh, great. Thanks. Where would that be?

CORDELIA
I’ll show you.

As the girls walk through the crowded hall.

CORDELIA
You transferred from Hemery, right? In L.A.?
BUFFY
Yeah.

CORDELIA
Oh! I would kill to live in L.A. 
Being that close to that many shoes… Why’d you come here?

BUFFY
Because my Mom moved, is the reason. I mean we both moved. But my Mom wanted to.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL – CONTINUOUS

CORDELIA
Well, you’ll be okay here. If you hang with me and mine you’ll be accepted in no time. Of
course we do have to test your coolness factor. You’re from L.A., so you can skip the written,
but, let’s see… Vamp nail polish.
BUFFY
(tentatively)
Over?

CORDELIA
SO over. James Spader.

BUFFY
He needs to call me.

CORDELIA
Trendy but tasty.
John Tesh.

BUFFY
The Devil?

CORDELIA
Well, that was pretty much a gimme, but you passed.

BUFFY
Oh, good.

They stop at the water fountain, which is being used by:

CORDELIA
Willow! Nice dress
(off Willow’s smile)
Good to know you’ve seen the softer side of Sears.
That hurt. Buffy says nothing, surprised by Cordelia’s sudden viciousness. Willow says, almost apologetically:

WILLOW
Well my Mom picked it out.
CORDELIA
(witheringly)
No wonder you’re such a guy-magnet. 
Are you done?

WILLOW
Oh.

She vacates the fountain. Cordy steps up to it, looking at Buffy.

CORDELIA
You wanna fit in here, the first rule is “know your losers”. Once you can identify them all by 
sight, they’re a lot easier to avoid.
She bends down to drink. Buffy looks at the departing Willow, unhappily.

CUT TO:
INT. ANOTHER HALL – A MINUTE LATER

As Buffy and Cordelia walk toward the library.

CORDELIA
--and if you’re not too swamped with catching up you should come out to the Bronze tonight.
BUFFY
The who?

CORDELIA
The Bronze. It’s the only club worth going to around here. They let anybody in but it’s still the
scene. It’s in the bad part of town.

BUFFY
Where’s that?

CORDELIA
About half a block from the good part of town. We don’t have a whole lot of town. You should
show.

They arrive at the entrance to the library.

BUFFY
Well, I’ll try, thanks.
CORDELIA
Good. I’ll see you at gym and you can tell me absolutely everything there is to know about
yourself.

She goes off.

BUFFY
(thrown by the notion)
That sounds like fun…
CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY – CONTINUOUS

Buffy enters, looking about her. It’s elegant, full of dark wood, streaming sunlight, and (duhh) books. It’s also empty. Buffy steps in, looking around. She looks down at the check-out counter to see:

ANGLE: A NEWSPAPER

Folded, with an article on the first page circled in red. The headline reads: LOCAL BOYS STILL MISSING, with a blurry picture of three brothers.

Buffy wanders further in. She peers around a bookcase –

BUFFY
Hello… Is anybody here?
And someone touches her from behind. Startled, she spins.

GILES
Can I help you?
He is British, of middle age, with a quiet intensity.

BUFFY
I was looking for some, well, books. I’m new.
GILES
Miss Summers.

BUFFY
Good call. I guess I’m the only new kid.

GILES
I’m Mr. Giles, the librarian.

BUFFY
Great. So you have, uh, --

GILES
I know what you’re after.

He leads her to the check-out desk by the door. His office can be seen behind it.

He pulls a book out and slides it toward Buffy. Huge leather bound, with a single word set in gild in the cover.

“VAMPYR”

Real concern floods Buffy’s face, along with the understanding. She steps back from the desk, eyes on the librarian.

BUFFY
That’s not what I’m looking for.
GILES
Are you sure?

BUFFY
I’m way sure.

GILES
My mistake.

He replaces the book under the counter.

GILES
So, what is it you said –
But she’s gone.

CUT TO:
INT. WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM – AFTERNOON

Two GIRLS approach their lockers, talking. They begin undressing (just shoes and coats and stuff. Get your mind out of the gutter.)

GIRL #1
The new kid? She seems kind of weird to me. And what kind of name is Buffy?
GIRL #2
Hey, Aphrodesia.

GIRL #1
Hey.

GIRL #3
Well, the chatter in the caf is that she got kicked out and that’s why her mom had to get a new
job.

GIRL #1
Neg.

GIRL #3
Pos. She was starting fights.

GIRL #1
(opening her locker)
Negly!

GIRL #3 [hand written: “- AURA”]
(opening hers)
Well, I heard it from Blue, and she saw the transcripts –

Something FLIES OUT of the locker at her! She SCREAMS as the dead body of the boy from the opening collapses on her, eyes horribly wide.

ANGLE: FROM ABOVE

The body sprawls out on the floor as the girl steps back, screaming for all she’s worth.

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT ONE
Act Two
EXT. FOUNTAIN QUAD – DAY
Willow is carefully taking out her packed lunch (and how healthy it is). Buffy approaches her.

BUFFY
Uh, hi. Willow, right?
WILLOW
Why? I mean Hi. Did you want me to move?

BUFFY
Why don’t we start with “hi, I’m Buffy.”
(sits by her)
And then let’s segue directly into me asking you for a favor. It doesn’t involve moving, but it
does involve you hanging out with me for a while.

WILLOW
But aren’t you… hanging with Cordelia?

BUFFY
I can’t do both?

WILLOW
Not legally.

BUFFY
Look, I really want to get by here. New school… Cordelia’s been really nice – to me, anyway –
but I have this burning desire not to flunk all my classes, and I heard a rumor that you were the
person to talk to if I wanted to get caught up.

WILLOW
Oh, I could totally help you out! If you have sixth period free we could meet in the library –

BUFFY
–or not. Or, you know, we could meet somewhere quieter. Louder. That place kind of gives me a 
wiggins.

WILLOW
It has that effect on most kids. I love it, though. It’s a great collection, and the new librarian’s
really cool.

BUFFY
He’s new?

WILLOW
Yeah, he just started. He was a curator of some British Museum. Or the British museum, I’m not
sure. But he knows everything and he brought all these historical volumes and biographies and
am I the single dullest person alive?

BUFFY
Not at all!

XANDER
(entering with Jesse)
Hey. Are you guys busy? Can we interrupt? We’re interrupting.

BUFFY
Hey.

JESSE
Hey there.

WILLOW
Buffy, this is Jesse, and that’s Xander.

XANDER
Oh, me and Buffy go way back. Old friends, very close. Then there was that period of
estrangement, I think we were both changing as people, but here we are and it’s like old times,
I’m quite moved.

JESSE
Is it me, or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?

XANDER
(a little embarrassed)
It’s not you.

BUFFY
It’s nice to meeting you guys… I think.

JESSE
Well, we wanted to welcome you, make you feel at home. Unless you have a scary home.

XANDER
And to return this.

He produces the stake.

[ Handwritten to the left side - "She takes it”]

XANDER
The only thing I can figure is that you’re building a really little fence.
BUFFY Oh. No. That was for self defense. Everyone has them in L.A. Pepper spray is so passe.

XANDER
So. What do you like, what do you do for fun, what do you look for in a man… Let’s hear it.

JESSE
If you have any dark, painful secrets that we could publish…

BUFFY
Gee, everybody wants to know about me. How keen.

XANDER
Well, not a lot happens in a one-Starbucks town like Sunnydale. You’re big news.

BUFFY
I’m not. Really.

CORDELIA
Are these people bothering you?

She has appeared behind Jesse, all disdain on her face.

BUFFY
Oh! No.
WILLOW
(covering for her)
She’s not hanging out with us.

JESSE
(smitten)
Hey, Cordelia.

CORDELIA
Oh, please.
(to Buffy)
I don’t want to interrupt your downward mobility. I just thought I’d tell you that you won’t be
meeting Coach Foster, the woman with chest hair, because gym has been canceled due to the
extreme dead guy in the locker.

BUFFY
What?

WILLOW
What are you talking about?

CORDELIA
Some guy was stuffed in Aura’s locker.

BUFFY
Dead.

CORDELIA
Way dead.

XANDER
So not just a little dead then.

CORDELIA
Don’t you have an elsewhere to be?

JESSE
(to Cordelia)
If you need a shoulder to cry on, or just to nibble on –

BUFFY
How did he die?

CORDELIA
I don’t know…

BUFFY
Well, were there any marks?

CORDELIA
Morbid much? I didn’t ask!

BUFFY
Uh, look, I gotta book. I’ll see you guys later.

She takes off, the others watching her.

CORDELIA
What’s her deal?
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKER ROOM – CONTINUOUS

Mr. Flutie closes the door quietly. He turns to see Buffy before him.

MR FLUTIE
Oh! Buffy! Uh, what do you want?
BUFFY
Um, is there a guy in there that’s dead?

MR FLUTIE
Where did you hear that? Okay. Yes. But he’s not a student! Not currently.

BUFFY
Do you know how he died?

MR FLUTIE
What?

BUFFY
I mean – how could this have happened?

MR FLUTIE
Well, that’s for the police to determine when they get here. But this structure is safe, we have inspections,
and I think there’s no grounds for a lawsuit.

BUFFY
Was there a lot of blood? Was there any blood?

MR FLUTIE
I would think you wouldn’t want to involve yourself in this kind of thing.

BUFFY
I don’t. Could I just take a peek?

MR FLUTIE
Unless you already are involved…

BUFFY
Never mind.

MR FLUTIE
(being nicer)
Buffy, I understand this is confusing. You’re probably feeling a lot right now. You should share
those feelings. With someone else.

Buffy smiles wanly, backs off.

CUT TO:
EXT. SIDE OF GYM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy comes around the side of the gym. There is a door to the locker room and she tries it. It’s locked.

She looks around to make sure she’s alone, and then PULLS the door open with a quick tug, splintering the lock. One last look around and she slips inside.

CUT TO:
INT. WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy approaches the body laid out under a blanket.

She hesitates, sure she’s not going to like what she sees. Pulls the blanket from his head and shoulders.

ANGLE: HIS NECK

Has two big ol’ bite marks in it.

What floods onto Buffy’s face is not horror, but grim frustration. She stares down at the body, nearly seething.

BUFFY
Oh, great!
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY – MOMENTS LATER

Buffy strides back in, attitude high.

BUFFY
Okay, what’s the sitch?
She spies Giles and starts up toward him.

GILES 
Sorry?
BUFFY
You heard about the dead guy, right? The dead guy in the locker?

GILES
Yes.

BUFFY
Well, it’s the weirdest thing. He’s got two little holes in his neck and all his blood’s been
drained. Isn’t that bizarre? Aren’t you just going, “Ooooh….”

GILES
I was afraid of this.

BUFFY
Well, I wasn’t! It’s my first day. I was afraid that I’d be behind in all the classes, that I wouldn’t 
make any friends, that I’d have last month’s hair. I didn’t think there would be vampires
on campus. And I don’t care.

GILES
Then why are you here?

She’s stopped for a moment.

BUFFY
To tell you that I don’t care. Which I don’t, and… have now told you. So bye.
She starts out, maybe a little unsatisfied with her exit.

GILES
Will he rise again?
BUFFY
Who?

GILES
The boy.

BUFFY
No, he’s just dead.

GILES
Can you be sure?

BUFFY
To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood and then you have to suck their blood, it’s a
whole big sucking thing. Mostly they’ll just take all your blood and then you just die – why am I
still talking to you?

GILES
You have no idea what’s going on, do you? Do you think it’s coincidence, your coming here?
That boy was just the beginning.

BUFFY
(turning)
Oh, why can’t you leave me alone?

GILES
Because you are the Slayer.

She stops. No comeback just now. He starts down after her, solemnly intoning:

GILES
Into every generation a slayer is born. One girl, in all the world, a Chosen One. One born with the –
She finishes along with him:

BUFFY & GILES
--the strength and skill to hunt the vampires –
BUFFY
The stop the spread of their evil blah blah I’ve heard it, okay?

GILES
I don’t understand this attitude. You’ve accepted your duty, you’ve slain vampires before –

BUFFY
Well, I have both been there and done that. And I am moving on.

GILES
What do you know about this town?

BUFFY
It’s two hours on the freeway from Neiman Marcus.

GILES
Dig a bit in the history of this place and you’ll find there’ve been a steady stream of fairly odd
occurrences. I believe this area is a center of mystical energy. Things gravitate toward it that you
might not find elsewhere.

BUFFY
Like Vampires.

She tries to move past him and he pulls a book off the shelf, hands it to her. It resembles the vampire book he showed her earlier. He continues to pull more off, piling them up in her arms.

GILES
Like werewolves. Zombies. Succubi, incubi… Everything you ever dreaded under your bed and
told yourself couldn’t be by the light of day.
BUFFY
What, did you send away for the Time Life series?

GILES
Uh, yes.

BUFFY
Did you get the free phone?

GILES
The calendar.

BUFFY
Cool.
(remembering her agenda)
Okay, first of all, I’m a vampire slayer. And secondly, I’m retired. Hey, I know! Why don’t you
kill them?

GILES
I’m a watcher. I haven’t the skill.

BUFFY
Oh, come on. Stake through the heart, a little sunlight – it’s like falling off a log.

GILES
The Slayer slays. The Watcher –

BUFFY
Watches?

GILES
Yes. No! He – he – trains her, he prepares her –

BUFFY
Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out of school? Losing all my friends? Having to spend
all my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because it might ‘endanger’
them? Go ahead. Prepare me.

A beat, and she leaves. Giles heads out after her.

ANGLE: IN THE STACKS

A shadowy figure moves about back there, emerges into the light. It’s Xander, excitement, amusement and a disbelief dancing in his face. “Theories in Trig” in his hands.

He tries for a long time to form a word. When he does, it is merely:

XANDER
WHAT?
CUT TO:
INT. HALL – CONTINUOUS

Giles comes out of the library, calls out to Buffy.

GILES
It’s getting worse.
She stops, turns. There are people about, so they are forced to whisper.

BUFFY
What’s getting worse?
GILES
The influx of the undead, the supernatural occurrences. It’s been building for years and now… 
There’s a reason why you’re here, and there’s a reason why it’s now.

BUFFY
Because now is the time my mom moved here.

GILES
Something is coming. Something is going to happen here soon.

BUFFY
Gee, can you vague that up for me…?

GILES
As far as I can tell, the signs point to a crucial mystical upheaval very soon – days, possibly less.

BUFFY
Come on. This is Sunnydale. How bad an evil can there be here?

CUT TO:
INT. DARK PLACE – NIGHT

The camera TRACKS silently through a dark and eerie place. We see candles, broken statuary. A few figures bent in supplication. An ominous CHANTING fills the chamber.

As we move up, we see a single figure kneeling, well ahead of the rest. He is large, powerful, appears to be in his late twenties. In fact, LUKE is much older than that. His dress speaks of many eras, but definitely of none.

The CHANTING increases in intensity as the camera continues to move about the place, passing over Luke and we see what he is kneeling before for the first time.

A pool of blood.

LUKE
The sleeper will awaken.
As he speaks, we see his face clearly. Vampire. Not pretty.

LUKE
The sleeper will awaken. And the world will bleed.
He dips his finger in the blood.

LUKE
Amen.
And now we see:

WIDER ANGLE: THE CHURCH

It’s a bizarre ruin we’re in, buried beneath the ground. The stanchions and arches stand at haphazard angles, sheeted rock pushing in at all sides. The pool of blood is on what would be the altar.

The CHANTING fills the vast room as we

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT TWO
Act Three
INT. BUFFY’S BEDROOM – NIGHT
She is in the agony of outfit choosage, getting ready to go out. She has two, one scanty, the other somewhat plain. She holds them alternatively in front of her, looking in the mirror.

BUFFY
(holding up one)
Hi! I’m an enormous slut!
(the other)
Hi! Would you like a copy of the Watchtower?
(throws them both down)
I used to be so good at this…
Joyce enters, watches her.

JOYCE
Are you going out tonight, honey?
BUFFY
Yeah, Mom. I’m going to a club.

JOYCE
Will there be boys there?

BUFFY
No, Mom; it’s a nun club.

JOYCE
Well, just be careful.

BUFFY
I will.

As the conversation segues into serious territory, both women become somewhat uncomfortable with each other.

JOYCE
I think we can make it work here. I’ve got my positive energy flowing. I’m gonna get the gallery
on its feet – We may already have found a space.
BUFFY
Great.

JOYCE
And that school is a very nurturing environment, which is what you need.

BUFFY
Mom…

JOYCE
Oh, not too nurturing. I know. You’re sixteen, I read all about the dangers of overnurturing.
(honestly)
It’s hard. New town, and all. For me, too. I’m trying to make it work.
(correcting herself)
I’m going to make it work.

BUFFY
I know.

JOYCE
You’re a good girl, Buffy. You just fell in with the wrong crowd. But that’s all behind us now.

BUFFY
It is. From now on, I’m only hanging out with the living. I – I mean, the lively… people.

JOYCE
Okay, have fun.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET – NIGHT

Buffy makes her way on foot to the Bronze. She leaves the suburban area the house is in for the deserted city streets on the edge of town.

She turns a corner, walks down the street, lost in thought – until she HEARS FOOTSTEPS behind her.

She stops, turns slowly.

A figure stands in the dark behind her. Far enough away that she doesn’t feel right saying anything to it. It doesn’t move – she can’t see its face but it seems to be looking at her.

Buffy turns to go.

The figure follows.

CUT TO:
EXT. ANOTHER STREET – A MOMENT LATER

Buffy turns the corner, somewhat worried – moving faster. The figure follows, always at a discreet distance.

CUT TO:
EXT. AN ALLEY – A MOMENT LATER

Buffy turns in. She looks about her. A pipe runs across the narrow alley some ten feet above her. Garbage cans cluster at the other end.

ANGLE: THE FIGURE

Turns into the now-empty alley, starts down it.

Buffy suddenly DROPS down on him, legs locked over his neck. She throws herself back, tipping him over, rolling herself and SLAMMING his body onto the ground.

He’s on his feet quickly, but she grabs him and throws him up against the wall. She closes in, but he makes no move to attack. Puts up his hands.

ANGEL
Is there a problem, ma’am?
He seems faintly amused. Buffy eyes him suspiciously, getting her first good look at him.

ANGEL is strikingly handsome, with intelligence and a kind of distance in his eyes. Moves with a fighter’s grace.

BUFFY
There’s a problem. Why are you following me?
ANGEL
I know what you’re thinking, but don’t worry. I don’t bite.

She backs off a bit, perplexed.

ANGEL
Truth is, I thought you’d be taller. Or bigger, muscles and all that. You’re pretty spry, though.
BUFFY
What do you want?

ANGEL
Same thing you do.

BUFFY
Okay, what do I want?

The amusement leaves his face.

ANGEL
To kill ‘em. To kill ‘em all.
BUFFY
(game show: )
Sorry! That’s incorrect but you do get this lovely watch and a year’s worth of Turtle Wax what I
want… is to be left alone.

ANGEL
You really think that’s an option anymore? You’re standing at the mouth of Hell. And it’s about
to open.

He reaches into his coat for something. It’s a jewelry box. He throws it to her.

ANGEL
Don’t turn your back on this. You’ve got to be ready.
BUFFY
For what?

ANGEL
The Harvest.

He starts out.

BUFFY
Who are you?
ANGEL
Let’s just say I’m a friend.

BUFFY
(exasperated)
Well, maybe I don’t want a friend.

ANGEL
I didn’t say I was yours…

He goes. Buffy watches him go, then opens the box.

ANGLE: IN THE BOX

Is a cross. Small, antique, on a gold chain, [Handwritten to the side: “Silver”, ‘gold chain’ is circled]

WIDER ANGLE: BUFFY ALONE IN THE ALLEY

Buffy looks at the cross, at the departing figure of the mysterious man.

And as she walks slowly away, the camera TRACKS past the corner, past another group of garbage cans.

In front of them, right before us but unseen by Buffy, are two figures. The poor man we saw in her dream, and a vampire. The beast has its face burrowing in his neck, as the last of his life shudders out.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE BRONZE – NIGHT

A decent crowd mills aimlessly around the joint, high school students and older. The place has an appealingly dive-y earthiness; no waiting in line for the bouncer to decide whether you’re cool or not. Those that are in line wait only to pay the four bucks to get their hands stamped if they’re old enough to drink.

Buffy moves her way up the line, scanning about for a familiar face. She doesn’t find one. As she is let in we FOLLOW HER INTO:

INT. THE BRONZE – CONTINUOUS

It’s dark, crowded and noisy. A fairly thrashsome band holds forth on stage, blasting the kind of music that would cause major moshing in a rowdier crowd. Coffee bar in the back, and a balcony above with tables for two.

Buffy makes her way through, still looking about. A good looking GUY spies her and waves, smiling.

Buffy smiles vaguely, waving back. A moment before she realizes he’s waving to a guy right behind her. She attempts to turn her wave into fixing her hair, looking embarrassed.

ANGLE: WILLOW

Is getting a soda at the bar. She turns back to look at the band just as Buffy comes up to her.

BUFFY
Hi!
WILLOW
Oh, hi! Hi.

BUFFY
Are you here with someone?

WILLOW
No, I’m just here. I thought Xander was gonna show up…

BUFFY
Oh, are you guys going out?

WILLOW
No. We’re just friends. We used to go out, but we broke up.

BUFFY
How come?

WILLOW
He stole my barbie.
(off Buffy’s look)
We were five.

BUFFY
Oh.

WILLOW
I don’t actually date a whole lot… lately.

BUFFY
Why not?

WILLOW
Well, when I’m with a boy I like, it’s hard for me to say anything cool, or witty, or at all… I can
usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.

BUFFY
(laughing)
It’s not that bad. 
It is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.

BUFFY
You really haven’t been dating lately.

WILLOW
It’s probably easy for you.

BUFFY
(a little forlornly)
Oh, yeah. Real easy.

WILLOW
I mean, you don’t seem too shy.

BUFFY
Well, my philosophy is – do you wanna hear my philosophy?

WILLOW
I do.

BUFFY
Life is short.

WILLOW
Life is short.

BUFFY
Not original, I’ll grant you. But it’s true. Why waste time being all shy? Why worry about some
guy and if he’s gonna laugh at you? You know? Seize the moment. ‘Cause tomorrow you might
be dead.

WILLOW
Oh… That’s nice…

Buffy sees somebody moving about on the balcony. Her brow furrows.

BUFFY
Uh, I’ll be back in a minute.
WILLOW
That’s okay. You don’t have to come back.

BUFFY
(smiling at her self-effacing attitude)
I’ll be back in a minute.

She takes off, leaving Willow at the bar.

WILLOW
(to herself)
Seize the moment…
ANGLE: ATOP THE BALCONY

Buffy comes up, makes her way to the railing overlooking the stage. She leans on it, and we see that Giles is standing beside her. He doesn’t even look at her.

BUFFY
So, you like to party with the students? Isn’t that kind of skanky?
GILES
(witheringly)
Right. This is me having fun.
(looking out on stage)
Watching clown-hair prance about is hardly my idea of a party. I’d much prefer to be home with a cup of bovril and a good book.

BUFFY
STAT.

GILES
This is a perfect breeding ground for Vampire activity. Dark, crowded… Besides, I knew you
were likely to show up. And I have to make you understand –

BUFFY
That the Harvest is coming, I know, your friend told me.

GILES
(thrown)
What did you say?

BUFFY
The… Harvest. That means something to you? ‘Cause I’m drawing a blank.

GILES
I’m not sure… Who told you this?

BUFFY
This guy. Dark, gorgeous in an annoying sort of way. I figured you were buds.

GILES
No… The Harvest… Did he say anything else?

BUFFY
Something about the mouth of Hell. I really didn’t like him.

They both look down at the floor for a moment, at the dancing kids.

GILES
Look at them. Throwing themselves about…. Completely unaware of the danger that surrounds
them.
BUFFY
Lucky them…

GILES
Or perhaps you’re right. Perhaps there is no trouble coming. The signs could be wrong. It’s not as
though you’re having the nightmares…

And we MOVE IN on Buffy’s face, clouding over. She says nothing, just looks down at the dancing kids.

ANGLE: THE FLOOR

Kids writhe about to the music with healthy abandon.

We find Cordelia off to the side, watching with her friends.

CORDELIA
My mom doesn’t even get out of bed anymore. The doctor says it’s Epstein Barr, I’m like,
“please, it’s chronic hepatitis or at least Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.” I mean nobody cool has
Epstein Barr anymore.
Jesse approaches her, smiling.

JESSE
Cordelia!
CORDELIA
Oh, yay, it’s my stalker.

JESSE
Hey, you look great.

CORDELIA
Well, I’m glad we had this chat –

JESSE
Listen, I, um, do you wanna dance?

CORDELIA
(witheringly)
With you?

JESSE
Well, uh, yeah.

CORDELIA
Well, uh, no.

She takes off, posse in tow. Jesse just soaks up the pain.

JESSE
Fine. Plenty of other fish in the sea. Oh yeah. I’m on the prowl. Witness me prowling.
He looks around at the throng, officially beginning his prowl.

ANGLE: BUFFY AND GILES

In mid-conversation. Shaken by the dreams thing, Buffy is giving ground.

BUFFY
I didn’t say I’d never slay another vampire. I’m just not gonna get way extracurricular with it. If I
run into one, sure…
GILES
But will you be ready? There’s so much you don’t know, about them and about your own
powers. A vampire appears to be a normal person, until the feed is upon them. Only then do they
reveal their true demonic visage.

BUFFY
You’re like a textbook with arms! I know this!

GILES
The point is, a Slayer should be able to see them anyway. Without looking, without thinking. Can
you tell me if there’s a vampire in this building?

BUFFY
Maybe?

GILES
You should know! Even through this mass and this din you should be able to sense them. Try.
Reach out with your mind.

She looks down at the mass of kids on the floor. Furrows her brow.

GILES
You have to hone your senses, focus until the energy washes over you, till you can feel every
particle of –
BUFFY
There’s one.

Giles stops, nonplused.

GILES
What? Where?
BUFFY
(pointing)
Down there. Talking to that girl.

ANGLE: THEIR POV

In the corner stands a good looking young man, talking to a girl we can’t really see.

GILES
But you don’t know –
BUFFY
Oh, please. Look at his jacket. He’s got the sleeves rolled up. And the shirt… Deal with that
outfit for a moment.

GILES
It’s dated?

BUFFY
It’s carbon dated! Trust me: only someone who’s been living underground for ten years would
think that was the look.

GILES
But… you didn’t hone…

BUFFY
(noticing something)
Oh, no…

ANGLE: THE VAMPIRE

Is still chatting with the girl. He motions for her to come with him, and she comes into view.

It’s Willow.

GILES
Isn’t that –
BUFFY
Willow.

GILES
What is she doing?

BUFFY
Seizing the moment.

She starts toward the stairs.

ANGLE: WILLOW AND THE VAMPIRE BOY

Head out the back door by the stage.

Buffy fights her way down the stairs. She looks toward where they were and sees they’re gone. She looks about a moment, and then, guessing correctly, heads for the backstage door as well.

But it’s a struggle: the closer she gets to the stage, the more crowded it gets. She finally pushes to the door.

CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE – CONTINUOUS

It’s dark here, and somewhat labryinthian. Buffy moves slowly, cautiously. There is no one about.

She finds an old chair, snaps the leg off, a makeshift stake.

There is no one about. Buffy heads for the exit door. Sticks her head out it but there’s no one in the alley either.

Slowly, perturbed, she starts back for the main door.

She turns the corner and he’s ON HER! She grabs him, throws him up against the wall, holding him two feet off the ground –

Well, holding her, actually. Holding Cordelia, who has the same dumbfounded gape that the other girls coming out of the bathroom have.

BUFFY
Cordelia!
CORDELIA
Excuse me… could you be any weirder? Is there a more weirdness that you could have?

Buffy lets her down, lowering the stake.

CORDELIA
God, what is your childhood trauma?
BUFFY
(trying to be chipper)
Did you guys see Willow? Did she come by here?

CORDELIA
Why? Did you need to attack her with a stick?

Buffy gives up. Face red, she retreats back the way she came.

Cordy and the others are still agape. After a moment, Cordy regains her composure.

CORDELIA
Excuse me. I have to call everyone that I’ve ever met right now.
CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE – CONTINUOUS

Buffy comes back out, finds Giles at the bottom of the stairs. She looks around as he says:

GILES
Is he dead? 
That was fast. Well done. I’d best go to the library. This “Harvest” is –
BUFFY
I didn’t find them.

GILES
The vampire’s not dead?

BUFFY
No, but my social life is on the critical list.

GILES
What do we do?

BUFFY
You go on. I’ll take care of it.

GILES
I should come with you, no?

BUFFY
(heading out)
Don’t worry. One vampire I can handle.

As she exits, she brushes past Jesse. The camera STAYS on him, as we see he is chatting up a girl.

JESSE
What did you say your name was?
And the camera comes around to show the girl he’s talking to: it’s the vampire from the opening. Needless to say, she has her normal face on. And she’ll be known from now on as:

DARLA
Darla.
JESSE
Darla. I haven’t seen you before. 
Are you from around here?

DARLA
No, but I’ve got family here.

JESSE
Have I met them?

DARLA
You probably will.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH – CONTINOUS

The CHANTING we heard earlier continues, peaking in intensity. By the altar, Luke suddenly looks up.

He starts moving slowly back, eyes wide with religious fervor. All the figures in the church start moving back, almost as one.

ANGLE: THE POOL OF BLOOD

We are low, right above the surface, as Luke prays before it. Suddenly a HEAD shoots up from in the blood. Luke starts, looks at it. He moves back, away from the pool.

Something breaks the surface of the liquid. Something rises.

It is THE MASTER, the most powerful of vampires. Born Heinrich Joseph Nest (some six hundred years ago,) he wears a vaguely SS-like outfit.

What he does not wear is anything resembling a human face. He is as much demon as man. As powerful as Luke is, it’s clear that this man is much more so, both from his bearing and from the reverence with which Luke looks upon him.

LUKE
Master…
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT THREE
Act Four
INT. THE CHURCH – MOMENTS LATER
The Master steps forward, his face still in relative darkness. Luke steps back reverentially. The Master looks about him for a moment.

THE MASTER
Luke.
LUKE
Master…

THE MASTER
I am weak.

LUKE
Come the Harvest, you’ll be restored.

THE MASTER
The Harvest…

LUKE
We’re almost there. Soon you’ll be free.

The Master takes another step forward, past Luke. He reaches his hand out slowly. As he does, the air in front of him starts to ripple slightly – a kind of mystical wall. He pulls his hand back.

THE MASTER
I must be ready. I need my strength.
LUKE
I’ve sent your servants to bring you some food.

THE MASTER
Good.

Luke starts out.

THE MASTER 
Luke…
LUKE
(stopping)
Yes?

THE MASTER
Bring me something… young.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET BY WOODED GLADE – NIGHT

Willow and the Vampire Boy walk along, alone in the dark. She is clearly nervous, though not for the reason she should be.

WILLOW
Sure is dark…
VAMPIRE BOY
It’s night.

WILLOW
That’s a dark time. Night. Traditionally.

They walk a bit more.

WILLOW
I still can’t believe I’ve never seen you at school. Do you have Mr. Chomsky for History.
He doesn’t answer. Stops.

WILLOW
The ice cream bar’s down this way – it’s past Hamilton street.
He takes her hand.

VAMPIRE BOY
I know a shortcut.
He leads her into the dark of wood.

CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRONZE – NIGHT

Buffy comes from around the back, looking around. Xander comes up to her, carrying his skateboard.

XANDER
You’re leaving already?
BUFFY
Xander, have you seen Willow?

XANDER
Not tonight.

BUFFY
I need to find her. She left with a guy.

XANDER
We are talking about Willow, right?
(impressed)
Scoring at the Bronze. Work it, girlfriend.

BUFFY
(looking around)
Where would they go?

XANDER
Why, you know something about Mr. Goodbar that she doesn’t? Oh! Hey. I hope he’s not a
vampire. ‘Cause then you’d have to slay him.

She turns back to him, surprised and miffed.

BUFFY
Was there a school bulletin? Was it in the news? Is there anybody in this town who doesn’t
know I’m a slayer?
XANDER
I only know that you think you’re a slayer, and I only know that ‘cause I was in the library today.

BUFFY
Whatever. Just tell me where Willow would go.

XANDER
You’re serious.

BUFFY
We don’t find her, there’s gonna be another dead body in the morning.

A beat, as he looks at her. Sees she isn’t kidding. Isn’t wrong.

XANDER
Come on.
As they head off.

CUT TO:
EXT. GRAVEYARD – CONTINUOUS

Willow is still walking with Vampire Boy, but getting increasingly creeped out.

WILLOW
Okay, this is nice and… scary… 
Are you sure this is faster?
He says nothing. She keeps walking beside him, uncertain.

He stops at a small mausoleum. The entrance is a well of black.

VAMPIRE BOY
Hey. You ever been in one of these?
WILLOW
No thank you.

He moves in close, holding her intimately.

VAMPIRE BOY
Come on. What are you afraid of?
He pushes her into the blackness of the entrance.

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Willow stumbles in. She looks about her frightenedly, adjusting to the increased dark.

The place is small, with carved stone walls. A large tomb takes up much of the middle, the stone figure of a man lying atop it. Behind her is the doorway she came in, ahead, a much smaller, iron door, locked shut.

She spins all the way round to see the boy filling the entrance.

WILLOW
That wasn’t funny.
No response. He steps closer, his face in shadow. She circles away from him, moving closer to the doorway.

WILLOW
I think I’m gonna go.
VAMPIRE BOY
Is that what you think?

All the playfulness has drained out of his voice. She takes a step back, another, turns and moves WHAM – right into DARLA.

Emitting something between a scream and a squeak, Willow steps back. Darla looks at her, at the boy.

DARLA
(to him; re: her)
Is this the best you could do?
VAMPIRE BOY
She’s fresh.

DARLA
Hardly enough to share.

VAMPIRE BOY
Why didn’t you bring your own?

DARLA
I did.

She indicates the doorway behind her, as Jesse stumbles dazed from the darkness.

JESSE
Hey, wait up…
WILLOW
Jesse!

She goes over to him, relieved. He is clutching his neck.

JESSE
(to Darla)
I think you gave me a hickey…
He takes his hand away. There is blood on it, on his neck. Willow looks over at the other two, eyes wide.

DARLA
(off the boy’s look)
I got hungry on the way.
WILLOW
Jesse, let’s get out of here.

DARLA
You’re not going anywhere.

WILLOW
Leave us alone.

DARLA
(in Willow’s face)
You’re not going anywhere until we’ve FED!

And on the last word she brings her face right up to Willow’s and it CHANGES, snaps right before our eyes into the grotesque demon-face we saw before.

Willow SCREAMS, takes a stumbled step back and falls.

The boy laughs, circling, and we see that he has changed as well.

BUFFY
Well, this is nice.
She steps in, Xander following her. Everybody stops.

BUFFY
A little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows – call it home.
DARLA
Who the hell are you?

BUFFY
Wow, you mean there’s actually somebody around here who doesn’t know already? That’s a
relief. I’m telling you, having a secret identity in this town is a job of work.

He is moving between the two Vampires, who loosen their grip on their respective victims.

XANDER
Buffy, we bail now, right?
VAMPIRE BOY
Not yet.

BUFFY
Okay, first of all, what’s with this outfit? Live in the now, okay? You look like DeBarge.
(turning to Darla)
Now, we can do this the hard way, or… well, actually, there’s just the hard way.

DARLA
Fine with me.

BUFFY
You sure? It’s not gonna be pretty. We’re talking violence, strong language, adult content.

As she speaks, the Boy Vampire RUSHES her from behind, charging at her with incredible speed and momentum –

Buffy whips a stake out from her jacket and in one graceful motion sticks it out behind her, letting the boy impale himself on it. He stops, eyes wide, and falls back.

Buffy never even faces him.

ANGLE: THE BOY VAMPIRE

As he hits the ground, his body crumbles to dust.

BUFFY
(to Darla)
See what happens when you roughhouse?
Xander and Willow are speechless, staring at the ground where a body used to be.

Darla is wide eyed, exceedingly wary. But not cowed. She moves slowly around, preparing to fight herself.

DARLA
He was young. And stupid.
BUFFY
Xander, go.

DARLA
Don’t go far.

She lunges at Buffy, who parries her blows with martial arts precision.

Xander herds the others out.

CUT TO:
EXT. GRAVEYARD – CONTINUOUS

The three kids run out of the mausoleum, Willow and Xander supporting Jesse. All three are totally freaked – Jesse the least so, since he’s still weak and dazed.

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Darla hit the ground with a painful thud.

Buffy stands over her. She’s a bit out of breath, and the humor is gone from her visage.

BUFFY
You know, I just wanted to start over. Be like everybody else. Have some friends, maybe a dog…
But no. You had to come here. You couldn’t go suck on some other town.
DARLA
Who are you?

BUFFY
Don’t you know?

HANDS suddenly grab Buffy by the throat, lift her bodily from the ground.

LUKE
I don’t care.
He steps out of the shadows from behind her – his bulk dwarfing her – and throws her a good fifteen feet. She hits the wall face first, landing badly.

Luke turns on Darla, who is getting up.

LUKE
You were supposed to be bringing an offering for the Master. We’re almost at Harvest and you
dally with this child?
DARLA
We had someone. But she came and… she killed Thomas… Luke, she’s strong.

LUKE
(contemptuously)
You go. I’ll see if I can handle the little girl.

ANGLE: BUFFY

She lifts herself off the floor just as Luke suddenly closes on her, grabs her. She’s ready this time, though, and she knocks his arms away, kicks him in the face. It sends him back a bit but he recovers in a second, landing a solid punch to her jaw.

LUKE
You are strong.
He slams her back to the ground.

LUKE
I’m stronger.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE FOREST – CONTINUOUS

The three kids are making pretty good time, despite having to support Jesse.

WILLOW
We’ll get the police – it’s just a few blocks up –
They stop. They stare, despair creeping onto their faces.

Three Vampires stand waiting for them.

CUT TO:
INT. THE MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy looks like she’s been kicked around a bit. She circles around the tomb, keeping it between her and Luke.

LUKE
You’re wasting my time.
BUFFY
Hey, I had other plans, too, okay?

He SHOVES the top of the tomb with all his might, sends it flying at her.

She LEAPS over it – jumps up onto the tomb, leaps off it, flipping, and WHAM – plants both feet solidly in Luke’s chest.

He falls back, as does she – she gets up first and pulls out her stake, dries it toward his chest – but he grabs just before it reaches.

LUKE
You think you can stop me? Stop us?
He squeezes – and the stake splinters in his powerful grip. He PUNCHES Buffy, knocks her back.

LUKE
You have no idea what you’re dealing with.
He stands, triumphant, over her. Begins intoning the sacred text:

LUKE
And like a plague of boils, the race of Man covered the earth. But on the third day of the newest
light will come over the Harvest…
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY – CONTINUOUS

Giles has his ancient texts out, is studying them in growing consternation.

LUKE (V.O.)
… when the blood of men will flow as wine…
ANGLE: GILES’ BOOK

Shows a Dore-like engraving: a massacre. People writhing, blood everywhere – in the center of them all, a Demon with a three-pointed star on his forehead, feeding off a woman.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH – CONTINUOUS

We TRACK IN on the Master sitting, his face in darkness.

LUKE (V.O.)
… when the Master will walk among them once more…
CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST – CONTINUOUS

Xander, Willow and Jesse back away from the vampires –

LUKE (V.O.)
… the world will belong to the Old Ones…
--to find Darla right behind them!

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM – CONTINUOUS

Buffy is getting up, keeping her eyes on Luke –

…and Hell itself will come to town.

She tries to move to the side, to get away – he backhands Buffy with all the force he has. She flies back – right into the tomb!

ANGLE: IN THE TOMB

Buffy falls and lands HARD on her back, the wind knocked out of her. She looks beside her – and sees the withered corpse of the tomb’s owner.

She’s hurt pretty bad. She looks up but no Luke. Only the walls of the tomb. He could be anywhere.

Slowly, achingly slowly, she lifts her head. Truly scared. Looks over one side of the tomb – nothing. Looks over the other.

Luke FILLS THE FRAME, roaring, jumping into the crypt on top of her.

She tries to fight him off but she’s well pinned. He contemplates her a moment with gleeful animal hunger. Teeth dripping. [Hand written: “Not”].

LUKE
Amen.
He bears down.

BLACK OUT.
TO BE CONTINUED

FADE IN:

INT. MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT

LUKE bears down on BUFFY, fangs bared. She struggles, but he's got her pinned. He rips open her shirt a bit to get at her throat. Grabs her - and SCREAMS.

He jumps back, SMOKE curling out of his hand.

ANGLE: BUFFY'S NECK

The cross Angel gave her has slipped out of an inside pocket.

Buffy takes the moment and KICKS with both legs, sends Luke flying back out of the tomb. She jumps up herself and before he can recover, she RUNS out of there.

CUT TO:
EXT. GRAVEYARD - CONTINUOUS

As fast as she can -- stumbling a bit and breathing hard from the beating she took -- Buffy books through the graveyard. As she reaches the trees on the edge of it, she looks back at the Mausoleum.

Nobody's coming.

She hears WILLOW SCREAM.

WILLOW
No! Nooo! Get -- off --
Buffy runs to the sound of the voice -- comes to find:

ANGLE: WILLOW

on the ground, struggling with a vampire.

The vampire has Willow pinned, is going in for the neck -- then he looks up, hearing something.

Buffy's foot whips into his face, sending him flying way back.

He lands hard on his back and scrambles away, holding his nose.

Buffy is all business now, looking around her in quiet fury. Her senses alert.

She hears a CRACK, some SCUFFING on the ground. Takes off, leaving Willow wide-eyed and freaked. After a moment, she rises and follows.

ANGLE: XANDER

is unconscious, being dragged away by two other vampires. They hear something behind them, turn slowly around.

It's Willow, stumbling out from behind a tree. She looks extremely unthreatening.

They turn back and Buffy is right in front of them. She takes them both out with one punch. They fly back, then scramble to their feet.

Buffy grabs a branch, snaps it off the tree. She comes at them with this makeshift stake -- nails one in the chest.

The other flees.

Willow runs up to XANDER, cradles his head. He is just coming to.

WILLOW
Xander, are you okay?
XANDER
Man... something hit me...

Buffy is still looking around, unsatisfied.

BUFFY
Where's Jesse?
WILLOW
I don't know -- they surrounded us -- he was really weak...

XANDER
That girl grabbed him. Took off.

BUFFY
Which way?

XANDER
I don't know.

Buffy looks into the night. The camera CIRCLES her as she looks around. There is nothing to see.

BUFFY
(quietly)
Jesse...
BLACK OUT.
END OF TEASER
Act One
INT. THE LIBRARY - MORNING
We open on a Globe. As we hear GILES begin to SPEAK, we PAN over to Xander and Willow, sitting in the middle of the library. Neither of them appears to have slept since last night.

GILES (O.S.)
This world is older than any of you know, and
contrary to popular mythology, it did not begin
as a paradise. For untold eons, Demons walked the
earth; made it their home... their Hell.
Still we PAN, to find Giles on the upper level, standing at the railing. His expression is as grave as theirs.

GILES
In time they lost their purchase on this reality,
and the way was made for the mortal animals. For
Man. What remains of the Old Ones are vestiges:
Certain magicks, certain creatures...
BUFFY
And vampires...

She emerges from Giles' office, wrapping a bandage around her forearm. Xander rises, agitated.

XANDER
Okay, this is where I have a problem, see,
because we're now talking about vampires. We're
having a talk with vampires in it.
WILLOW
Oooh... I need to sit down.

BUFFY
You are sitting down.

WILLOW
Oh. Good for me.

XANDER
So vampires are demons?

GILES
The books tell that the last Demon to leave this
reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He
was a human form possessed -- infected -- by the
Demon's soul. He bit another, and another... and
so they walk the earth, feeding. Killing some,
mixing their blood with others to make more of
their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out,
and the Old Ones to return.

CUT TO:
INT. A TUNNEL - MORNING

Not that you could see whether it was morning or night in this place -- it remains as dark and humid as the earth that swallowed it.

JESSE is being dragged through the tunnel by Luke, DARLA, by his side. Jesse is still staggering into consciousness, and the more he awakens, the less he likes it.

He looks about in fear at the two inhuman faces, at the end of the tunnel they are dragging him through. It seems to be an old cracked pipe, and it ends at:

INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

Coming out of the pipe, the threesome makes its way down a pile of rocks to the floor of the wrecked church.

Jesse looks about, wonder tingeing the edges of his fear. He is stood before the altar, before the pool of blood.

From the darkness, something moves. Emerges.

THE MASTER regards his servants, his total authority obvious to all. He looks at Jesse.

THE MASTER
Is this for me?
LUKE
An offering, Master.

DARLA
He's a good one. His blood is pure.

THE MASTER
(quietly -- almost innocuously)
You've tasted it.

Darla starts back a step, afraid.

THE MASTER
(smiling)
I'm your faithful dog. You bring me scraps.
DARLA
I didn't mean to --

THE MASTER I've waited. For three score years I have waited.
While you come and go I have been stuck here,
(voice rising)
here, in a house of worship. My ascension is
almost at hand. Pray that when it comes... I'm in
a better mood.

DARLA
Master, forgive me. We had more offerings but
there was trouble. A girl.

LUKE
There was a girl. She fought well, and she knew 
of our breed. It's possible that she may be...

The Master turns to him.

THE MASTER
A Slayer?
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

XANDER
And that would be a what?
GILES
As long as there have been vampires, there has
been the Slayer. One girl in all the world --

BUFFY
He loves doing this part.

GILES
(speeding up)
All right: They hunt vampires, one Slayer dies,
the next is called, Buffy is the Slayer, don't
tell anyone. I think that's all the vampire 
information you need.

XANDER
Except for one thing. How do you kill them?

BUFFY
You don't. I do.

XANDER
Well, Jesse --

BUFFY
Jesse's my responsibility. I let him get taken.

XANDER
That's not true.

WILLOW
If you hadn't showed up, they would have... taken
us too... Does anybody mind if I pass out.

BUFFY
Breathe...

WILLOW
Breathe.

BUFFY
Breathe.
(to Giles)
This big guy, Luke, he talked about an offering
to the Master. I don't know who or what, but if
they weren't just feeding, Jesse may still be
alive. I'm gonna find him.

WILLOW
This is probably the dumb question, but shouldn't
we call the police?

GILES
Do you think they'd believe us?

WILLOW
We don't have to say vampires. We could say there
was... a bad man.

BUFFY
They couldn't handle it if they did come. They'd
only show up with guns.

GILES
(to Buffy)
You've no idea where they took Jesse?

BUFFY
I looked around, but... soon as they got clear of
the woods they could have just
(indicating flight)
--whoom.

XANDER
They can fly?

BUFFY
They can drive.

XANDER
Oh.

WILLOW
I don't remember hearing a car...

GILES
Well, let's take an enormous intuitive leap and
say they went underground.

BUFFY
Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get
anywhere in town without catching any rays. I
didn't see any access around there, though.

XANDER
Well, there's electrical tunnels. They run under
the whole town.

GILES
If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system, it
might indicate a meeting place. I suppose we
could go to the building commission --

BUFFY
We so don't have time.

WILLOW
Uh, guys? There may be another way.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

THE MASTER
A Slayer... Have you any proof?
LUKE
Only that she fought me and yet lives.

THE MASTER
Very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the
last time that happened.

LUKE
1843, in Madrid. And the bastard caught me
sleeping.

THE MASTER
She mustn't be allowed to interfere with the
Harvest.

LUKE
I would never let that happen.

THE MASTER
You needn't worry. I believe she'll come to us.
We have something that she wants. If she is a
Slayer, and this boy lives, she'll try to save
him.

Luke goes up to Jesse, smiling.

LUKE
I thought you nothing more than a meal, boy.
Congratulations. You've just been upgraded to
"bait".

INT. THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE: A MAP OF THE ELECTRICAL TUNNELS

On a computer screen.

BUFFY (O.S.)
There it is.
WIDE ANGLE:

Willow sits at the computer, everyone else gathered around her.

WILLOW
This runs under the graveyard.
XANDER
I don't see any access.

GILES
So all the city plans are just open to the
public?

WILLOW
Uh, well, in a way. I sort of stumbled onto them
when I accidentally... decrypted the city
council's security system.

XANDER
(still focused on the screen)
Someone's been naughty...

BUFFY
There's nothing here. This is useless!

GILES
I think you should ease up on yourself.

BUFFY 
You're the one who told me I wasn't prepared
enough. Understatement. I thought I was on top of
it, and then that Monster Luke came out of
nowhere --

She stops. Pauses.

XANDER
What?
BUFFY
(working it out)
He didn't come out of nowhere. He came from
behind me. I was facing the entrance. He came
from behind me and he didn't follow me out.
(looks at them)
The access to the tunnels is in the mausoleum.

GILES
Are you sure?

BUFFY
The girl must have doubled back with Jesse after
I got out. God, I'm so mentally challenged!

XANDER
So, what's the plan? We saddle up, right?

BUFFY
There's no 'we'. Okay? I'm the Slayer, and you're
not.

XANDER
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face.

BUFFY
Xander, this is deeply dangerous.

XANDER
I'm inadequate. That's fine. I'm less than a man.

WILLOW
Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place
full of monsters, but I do want to help. I need
to.

GILES
Then help me. I've been researching this Harvest
affair. Seems to be some sort of pre-ordained
massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell on earth... Quite 
charmless. I am fuzzy on the details, however,
and it may be that you can wrest some information
from that dread machine.
(off their uncomprehending looks)
That was a bit British, wasn't it?

BUFFY
Welcome to the new world.

GILES
(translates to Willow)
I want you to go on the Net.

WILLOW
Oh! Yeah. Sure. I can do that.

BUFFY
Then I'm out of here.
(to Xander and Willow)
If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.

GILES
Do I have to tell you to be careful?

Buffy looks at him a moment. Then she's out.

CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

Buffy heads toward a gate that stands open. She is about to go through it when FLUTIE appears right behind her.

MR. FLUTIE
And where do we think we're going?
BUFFY
We? I? Me?

MR. FLUTIE We're not leaving school grounds, are we?

BUFFY
No! I'm just ... admiring the fence. This is
quality fencework.

MR. FLUTIE
Because if we were leaving school grounds on our
second day at a new school after being kicked out
of our old school for delinquent behavior -- do
you see where I'm going with this?

BUFFY
(it comes to her:)
Mr. Giles!

MR. FLUTIE
What?

BUFFY
He asked me to get a book for him. From the store
'cause I have a free period and I'm a big reader
did it mention that on my transcripts?

MR. FLUTIE
Mr. Giles.

BUFFY
Ask him.

Mr. Flutie shuts and locks the gate, saying:

MR. FLUTIE
Well, maybe that's how they do things in Britain,
they've got that royal family and all kinds of
problems. But here at Sunnydale nobody leaves 
campus while school's in session. Are we clear?
BUFFY
We're clear.

MR. FLUTIE
That's the Buffy Summers I want in my school. The
sensible girl, with her feet on the ground.

He smiles, leaves.

ANGLE: BUFFY'S FEET

Standing before the fence. After a bit they jump up, leave the frame. A moment later we see her land on the other side, take off running.

CUT TO:
INT. MAUSOLEUM - CONTINUOUS

But for the light from the doorway, it's just as dark in here as it was last night. Buffy makes her way cautiously, looking about her. She senses a lurking presence, but the shadows give up nothing.

She reaches the iron door on the other side. Tires it. It's locked. She stops, letting out a long breath.

BUFFY
(not looking around)
I don't suppose you've got a key on you?
ANGEL steps from the shadows, a smile in his eyes.

ANGEL
They really don't like me dropping in.
BUFFY
Why not?

ANGEL
They really don't like me.

BUFFY
(sarcastically)
How could that possibly be?

ANGEL
I knew you'd figure out this entryway sooner
or later. Actually, I thought it was gonna be a
little sooner.

BUFFY
I'm sorry you had to wait. Look, if you're gonna
be popping up with this cryptic wise man act on a
regular basis, can you at least tell me your 
name?

ANGEL
Angel.

BUFFY
Angel.
(offhand)
It's a pretty name.

ANGEL
Don't go down there.

BUFFY
Deal with my going.

ANGEL
You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk.
Tonight is the Harvest. Unless you can prevent it,
the Master walks.

BUFFY
If this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why
don't you stop it?

ANGEL
Because I'm afraid.

The unashamed openness of the statement catches her a bit off guard. She looks at him a moment.

She KICKS the door open.

ANGEL
They'll be expecting you.
BUFFY
I've got a friend down there -- or, a potential
friend.
(joking)
Do you know what it's like to have a friend?

He doesn't answer.

BUFFY
(gently)
That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.

ANGEL
When you hit the tunnels, head east, toward the
school. That's where you're likely to find them.

BUFFY
You gonna wish me luck?

He says nothing. She looks at him a moment more, then heads into the darkness.

He stands there, not moving. Quiet concern on his face.

ANGEL
(softly)
Good luck.
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT ONE
Act Two
INT. TUNNELS - DAY

They are dark, forbidding, and they run in all directions.

Buffy climbs down a ladder, drops into them. She looks about her, taking it in.

ANGLE: A RAT

Scurries by her foot.

Buffy doesn't flinch. She starts down a tunnel, moving slowly. The dark enveloping her.

She turns a corner, slowly. Nothing. Starts down it.

She hears something and spins, sneaks up and looks down another tunnel.

ANGLE: DOWN THE OTHER TUNNEL

Shadows. Noise. Nothing solid.

She pulls her head back and he's right behind her!

XANDER
Did you see anything?
BUFFY
Xander! What are you doing here?

XANDER
Something stupid. I followed you. I couldn't just
sit around not doing anything.

BUFFY
I understand. Now go away.

XANDER
Jesse's my bud, okay? If I can help him, then
that's what I gotta do.

A beat, as she accepts this.

XANDER
Besides, it's this or Chem class.
They make their way through the dark.

CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

Giles has his arcane volumes out, is consulting them. After some digging, he finds something interesting. He looks closely at one passage, translating to himself from the Latin.

GILES
"For they will gather, and be gathered. All that
is theirs shall be his... From the Vessel pours
life." Pours life...
ANGLE: AN ENGRAVING

A bestial fellow holds his hand out, commanding a throng of villagers, all of whom are bleeding. Below, in what might be Hell, a demon glows with power.

Upon the bestial one's forehead, a crude symbol has been drawn, a star with three points.

He looks over at another passage.

GILES
(reads)
"On the night of the crescent moon, the first
past the solstice, it will come." Of course.
(he looks up)
Tonight.
CUT TO:
INT. COMPUTER CLASS - DAY

Everyone is working, alone and in groups, devising programs. CORDELIA and HARMONY struggle mightily with theirs.

CORDELIA
No! It's suppose to find the syntax and match it.
Or, wait...
HARMONY
(typing slowly)
Are we going to the Bronze tonight?

CORDELIA
No, we're going to the other cool place in
Sunnydale.

Harmony looks at her inquisitively.

CORDELIA
Of course we're going to the Bronze! Friday
night, no cover. But you should have been there
last night.
HARMONY
(re: program)
I think we did this part wrong.

CORDELIA
Why do we have to devise these programs? Isn't
that what nerds are for?
(quietly)
What did she do?

Harmony cranes over to look at:

ANGLE: WILLOW

Sitting next to them, but in her own world. She is bringing things up on the Net, typing intently, scrolling, searching...

HARMONY
Uh, she's doing something else.
CUT TO:

INT. TUNNELS - LATER

Buffy and Xander turn a corner, ready for anything.

Nothing. They keep walking, alert. Xander picks up the conversation they were in:

XANDER
Okay, so: crosses, garlic, stake through the
heart.
BUFFY
That'll get it done.

XANDER
Cool. Of course, I don't actually have any of
those things.

BUFFY
(hands him a cross)
Good thinking.

XANDER
Well, the part of my brain that would tell me to
bring that stuff is still busy telling me not to
come down here. I brought this, though.

He produces a flashlight, turns it on.

BUFFY
Turn that off!
XANDER
(he does)
Okay, okay. So, what else?

BUFFY
What else what?

XANDER
For Vampire Slayage.

?

XANDER
(a little weakly)
So you've done some beheading in your time.

BUFFY
Oh, yeah. There was this one time, I was pinned
down by this vampire, he played left tackle for
the varsity -- I mean, before he was... well
anyway he's got one of those really thick necks
and all I've got is a little Exacto knife --
(off Xander's gape)
You're not loving this story.

XANDER
Actually, I find it oddly comforting.

CUT TO:
INT. COMPUTER CLASS - DAY

Willow is busily bringing up relevant data from the Net, her brow furrowed in concentration. At the next terminal, Cordelia is struggling with a program while holding court.

CORDELIA
Okay, and then "Pattern Run" right? Or "Go To
End". That's it.
HARMONY
Maybe... I think...

CORDELIA
Well, what does the book say?
(as Harmony looks it up)
So anyway, I come out of the bathroom and she
comes running at me with a stick, screaming, "I'm
gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!" I swear.

GUY
(leaning in)
Who?

CORDELIA
Buffy.

HARMONY
The new girl.

GUY
What's her deal?

CORDELIA
She's crazed!

HARMONY
Did you hear about her old school? Booted.

CORDELIA
I exhibit no surprise.

GUY
Why was she kicked out?

CORDELIA
'Cause she's a psycho-loony.

WILLOW
No, she's not.

Silence, as Cordelia registers the concept that Willow just contradicted her.

CORDELIA
What?
WILLOW
She's not a psycho. You don't even know her.

CORDELIA
Excuse me? Who gave you permission to exist? Do I
horn in on your private discussions? No. Why?
Because you're boring.

Willow looks down, hurt. She stands and takes some pages that have come up on the printer. The girls turn back to their project.

HARMONY
There. I think the program's done.
CORDELIA
Finally, the nightmare ends. Now how do we save
it?

WILLOW
(as she exits)
"Deliver."

CORDELIA
(staring at the screen)
Deliver -- where is that -- Oh!

ANGLE: A KEY

Marked "DEL". Cordelia hits it.

Long pause, the two girls staring at the screen, their smiles about to melt into perplexity as we

CUT TO:
INT. TUNNELS - LATER

Buffy and Xander are still making their way through the dark. The banter quotient has plummeted -- they're both fairly tense.

Buffy looks around, brow furrowed.

BUFFY
They're close
XANDER
How can you tell?

BUFFY
No rats.

Xander doesn't love that information, but he says nothing. Still they progress, until:

XANDER
Over there. What's that?
He indicates a small, dark side-chamber. Nothing can be seen past the first few inches.

They come up to it. Xander pulls out his flashlight, shines it.

ANGLE: IN THE CHAMBER

A beam of light finds a body, lying face down. It looks like

XANDER
Jesse!
BUFFY
Oh, no...

She starts forward, Xander keeping the light on her. Goes over to the body, reaches out --

and Jesse JUMPS UP, brandishing a pipe. He's about to slam her with it when Xander calls out:

XANDER
Jesse!
JESSE
(stops, amazed)
Xander?

He drops the pipe and the two friends hug. Xander pulls away, looking him over.

XANDER
Jesse, man, are you okay?
JESSE
I'm not okay on an epic scale. We gotta get out
of here!

He indicates his leg -- he's been chained to the wall.

XANDER
It's cool! Buffy's a superhero!
The superhero frowns at the chain, feels it.

BUFFY
(to Jesse)
Hold on.
She takes the pipe he dropped and SMASHES the look on his shackles. It's not a quiet operation.

XANDER
You think anybody heard that?
ANGLE: A TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

A few black shapes move in the shadows, hearing it.

ANGLE: BUFFY AND THE OTHERS

They start out.

JESSE
They knew you were gonna come. They said that I - 
I was the bait...
XANDER
Oh, now you tell us.

JESSE
I've seen their leader.

The look in his eyes describes their leader in detail.

Buffy leads the two boys back through the tunnel. She stops.

Shadows move at the other end.

BUFFY
Oops.
JESSE
Oh, no, no...

BUFFY
Do you know another way out?

JESSE
I don't, uh, maybe?

XANDER
Come on.

They truck out the other way.

CUT TO:
INT. A JUNCTION OF TUNNELS - A SECOND LATER

They come into this one, moving at a good clip. Try one avenue --

Eyes gleam in the dark. Whispered LAUGHS drift at us.

They turn back, pause at a fork.

JESSE
Wait, wait. They brought me through here! There's
a way up. I hope.
They take off.

CUT TO:
INT. A SUBTERRANEAN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They run in, vampires approaching slowly behind them. Look around, horror growing on their faces.

There is no door. There is no exit. Buffy and Xander look about them, frantically.

BUFFY
I don't think this is the way out.
She goes back to the doorway they came in, listens for the approaching vampires.

XANDER
We can't fight our way back through those
things... what do we do?
JESSE
I've got an idea...

And the CAMERA PANS over to Jesse standing right behind Xander. His visage grotesque, his smile icy. He's a vampire.

JESSE
You can die.
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT TWO
Act Three
INT. A SUBTERRANEAN ROOM - TWO SECONDS LATER
Xander backs away from Jesse. Buffy looks from him to the entrance, not sure what to do.

ANGLE: THE ENTRANCE

We HEAR approaching vampires, see shadows begin to move, thrown on the outer wall by figures down the hall.

XANDER
Jesse... Man, I'm sorry...
JESSE
Sorry? I feel good, Xander. I feel strong.

Buffy grabs the door, tries to close it. But it's tick metal, rusted open.

JESSE
I'm connected, man. To everything. I can hear the 
worms in the earth.
XANDER
Well, that's a plus.

JESSE
I know what the Master wants. I'll serve his
purpose. That means you die. And I feed.

BUFFY
Xander! The cross!

Xander holds it up -- and Jesse stops coming toward him. The smiles leaves his face.

Buffy continues trying to shut the door -- it's beginning to budge. But coming down the hall are:

ANGLE: THE VAMPIRES

Making their way down the hall to the door. They most slowly, grinning -- sure of victory.

XANDER
Jesse. Man, we're buds. Can't you remember?
JESSE
You're like a shadow to me now.

Xander moves forward, cross in hand.

XANDER
Then get out of my face.
Jesse stumbles back, pissed. Xander backs him toward the door.

Buffy continues to strain. The vampires approach.

Jesse lashes out, knocks the cross from Xander's grasp. He grins -- and then Buffy grabs him from behind and HURLS him out of the room, knocking vampires over like bowling pins.

BUFFY
Help me!
Xander snaps out of his shock and comes to the door with her. With both their backs to it, they slam it shut --

--an arm SHOOTS in, grasping for them. Buffy opens the door slightly and slams it again till the arm withdraws. She bolts the door, breathing heavily.

XANDER
I can't believe it... we were too late.
A resounding THUD shudders the door. The vampires are gonna break it down.

BUFFY
We need to get out of here.
XANDER
There is no out of here!

Another THUD and the door begins to buckle on its hinges. Buffy looks around -- there is some junk lying around. She throws it out of the way to see if there is a doorway behind it. No joy.

Xander also looks around. He spies:

ANGLE: AN AIR VENT

We can see just a hint of an air vent's grating behind a metal sheet. It's high up in the shadows.

XANDER
What's that?
Buffy sees it too. She throws a box down, steps on it to reach the vent. Pulls away the metal sheet, revealing the grate. It's big enough to climb through.

She begins trying to pry the grate open with her bare hands.

Another THUD. Xander looks from Buffy to the door.

Buffy pulls, behind a corner.

The door comes off its hinges enough for a vampire to put his fingers through, grip it.

Buffy RIPS the grating loose, throws it aside.

BUFFY
Come on!
And a vampire SHOOTS out of the air vent at her, grabbing her head.

The door comes out enough for a vampire to get its face in.

Buffy pulls the vampire all the way out of the vent, throws it to the floor. Jumps down on top of it.

BUFFY
(to Xander)
Go!
He runs by, climbs on the box as Buffy sinks a stake into the vampire's back. He sticks the flashlight in:

ANGLE: IN THE AIR VENT

Nothing. Clear.

He crawls in, starts worming his way down it.

ANGLE: THE DOOR

Breaks down. Vampires pile in.

Buffy jumps up and pulls herself into the air vent.

CUT TO:
INT. AIR VENT - CONTINUOUS

The two of them crawl along in the dark, the vampires at their heels.

They come to a wider space, with a ladder going up. Sunlight can be seen through the grating at the very top.

XANDER
Up?
BUFFY
UP!

He starts climbing, Buffy right behind him.

He gets to the top and opens the grating, climbs into:

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

It's deserted as Xander rolls out, reaches in to help Buffy up. She is almost out when

ANGLE: A HAND

grabs her ankle, starts pulling her back down.

She pulls up, bringing the hand up into the sunlight. It beings to SMOKE -- we hear a SHRIEK and it is withdrawn.

Buffy rolls out, slams the grating shut.

For a moment both of them just lie there, catching their breath.

INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

Giles is still pouring over his notes when Willow enters. He looks up, hoping to see

GILES
Buffy?
WILLOW
It's just me. So there's no word?

GILES
Not as of yet.

WILLOW
Well, I'm sure they're... great.

GILES
Did you find anything of interest?

She sits, shows him copied articles as she talks.

WILLOW
I think maybe. I looked through the old papers,
around the time of that big earthquake back in
'37. And for several months before it, there was
a rash of murders.
GILES
Great! I mean, not great in a good way... Go on.

WILLOW
They sound like the kind you were looking for.
Throats, blood. Months, and not even a clue.

GILES
It's all coming together. I rather wish it weren't.

CUT TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

We see a candle being lit, the last of a row. Darla steps back from it, the taper in her hand glowing softly.

As she does, another vampire does the same on the opposite wall. They are at the back of the church, staring ahead. The rows of candles run up to the altar, where the Master stands waiting.

CHANTING can be heard, a low, primal whisper.

Luke steps forward, pulling off his shirt. He steps forward, kneels before the Master. The Master holds out his hand. Luke leans forward and kisses it. The Master turn him open palm up and Luke kisses that as well. Gently, Luke takes the Master's wrist in his hand, brings his lips to that as well.

And bites it.

The Master winces, shuts his eyes. Luke feeds for a few moments, the rears his head back with holy pain.

THE MASTER
My blood runs with yours. My soul is your
province.
LUKE
My body is your instrument.

The Master takes a drop of blood from his wrist, dabs it on Luke's forehead, painting the three-pointed star. He speaks to the assembled:

THE MASTER
On this most hallowed night, we are as one. Luke
is the Vessel. Every soul he takes shall feed me.
Their souls will grant me the power to free
myself. Tonight I will walk the Earth... and the
stars themselves will hide.
CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Buffy and Xander enter, somewhat the worse for their adventure. Willow takes one look at their faces and doesn't have to ask. She does anyway.

WILLOW
Did you find Jesse?
XANDER
Yeah.

WILLOW
Was he dead?

BUFFY
Worse.

She sits heavily.

BUFFY
I'm sorry, Willow. We were too late. And they
were waiting for us.
WILLOW
At least you two are okay.

Xander kicks a trash bin in frustration.

XANDER
I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and
say they're not good.
BUFFY
So, Giles, you got anything that can make this
day worse?

GILES
How about the end of the world.

BUFFY
I knew I could count on you.

GILES
This is what we know. Some sixty years ago a very
old, very powerful vampire came to this shore,
and not just to feed.

BUFFY
He came 'cause this town is a mystical whoosit?

GILES
Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it
Boca Del Infierno -- roughly translated:
Hellmouth. A sort of portal from this reality to
the next. This vampire hoped to open it.

BUFFY
Bring the demons back.

XANDER
End of the world.

WILLOW
But he blew it. Or, I mean, there was an
earthquake that swallowed about half the town.
And him too -- or at least there were no more
vampire-type killings after.

GILES
Opening dimensional portals is tricky business.
Odds are he got himself stuck. Like a cork in a
bottle.

XANDER
And this Harvest thing is to get him out?

GILES
It comes once in a century, on this night. A
Master can draw power from one of his minions
while it feeds. Enough power to break free, and
to open the portal. The minion is called the
Vessel, and he bears this symbol.

He shows them a sketch of the three-pointed star.

BUFFY
So, I dust anyone sporting this look, and no
Harvest.
GILES
Simply put, yes.

BUFFY
Any clue where this little get-together is being
held?

GILES
Well, there are a number of possibilities--

XANDER
They're going to the Bronze.

WILLOW
Are you sure?

XANDER
Come on, tasty young morsels all over the place.
Anyway, that's where Jesse's gonna be. Trust me.

GILES
Then we need to get there. The sun will be down
before long.

They head out toward the door.

BUFFY
I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.
GILES
What for?

BUFFY
Supplies.

CUT TO:
ANGLE: THE SUN

Big and red, sinking low.

INT. BUFFY'S BEDROOM - DUSK

The last rays are streaming in as Buffy enters, starts going through her closet.

JOYCE (O.S.)
Buffy?
Buffy's mom, JOYCE SUMMERS, enters. Buffy keeps going through her clothes, picking out a good slaying outfit.

JOYCE
You're going out?
BUFFY
I have to.

JOYCE
I didn't hear you come in last night.

BUFFY
I was quiet.

JOYCE
It's happening again, isn't it?

Buffy stops, looks at her.

JOYCE
I got a call from your new principal. Says you
missed some classes today.
BUFFY
I was... running an errand.

She pulls an old trunk out of her closet. She opens it, starts going through it.

JOYCE
We haven't finished unpacking and I'm getting
calls from your principal.
BUFFY
Mom, I promise you, it's not gonna be like
before. But I have to go.

JOYCE
No.

BUFFY
Mom...

Buffy looks at the window, at the growing dark.

JOYCE
The tapes all say I should get used to saying it.
No.
BUFFY
This is important.

JOYCE
I know. You have to go out or it'll be the end of
the world. Everything is life or death when
you're a sixteen year old girl.

BUFFY
Mom, I don't have time to talk about it--

JOYCE
You've got all night, Buffy. You're not going
anywhere. Now you can stay up here and sulk if
you want. I won't hold it against you. But if you
want to come down, I'll make us some dinner.

Joyce leaves, closing the door quietly but firmly behind her. After a moment, Buffy reaches into the truck.

ANGLE: IN THE TRUNK

Girl stuff, memorabilia, Teen Beat magazines.

Buffy reaches in and lifts out the inside -- the trunk has a false bottom. Below it stakes, crosses, host, garlic, and a widemouthed jar of holy water.

Buffy takes out a particularly deadly looking stake. It fits in her hand like it's part of it. She stuffs it into a bag, along with a few other items.

She stands, goes to the door. Listens by it.

She gets to the window, opens it. Starts crawling out.

CUT TO:
ANGLE: THE HORIZON

The sun is gone. The sky a deepening blue.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - NIGHT

From the balcony, we look down on a pool game in progress. Tilt up to see Cordelia holding court at a table.

CORDELIA
Senior boys are the only way to go. They're just
a better class of person. The boys in our grade?
Forget about it. They're children. Like Jesse -- 
did you see him last night? The way he follows me
around... He's like a little puppy dog: you just
want to put him to sleep. Senior boys have
mystery, they have ... what's the word I'm
searching for? Cars.
A Cordette starts to speak. Cordelia interrupts.

CORDELIA
I'm just not the type to settle. If I go into a
clothing store, I always have to have the most
expensive thing not because it's expensive, but
because it costs more.
A Cordette starts to speak.

CORDELIA
Hello! Miss Motormouth -- can I get a sentence
finished? Oh! I love this song!
She gets up, friends in tow, and heads to the balcony.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

TILT UP on Cordelia, dancing away in the middle of the crowd. She looks great.

ANGLE: AT THE DOOR

Jesse walks in, a new man. A cool, subtle swagger in his step. His eyes go right to Cordelia. He smiles.

CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

There are a few peoples lounging around outside, but not much activity. Then, a ways off, we see them coming, walking slowly into the half-light.

Eight vampires. Luke in the middle.

None of them saying a word.

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT THREE
Act Four
INT. THE BRONZE - MOMENTS LATER
Cordelia is still dancing with her friends, having a good time.

Jesse makes his way slowly through the crowd, not towards but around her, his eyes never leaving her. She sees him too -- and for the first time, doesn't look away in disgust. There's something different about him.

A SLOW SONG starts playing, and Cordelia stops dancing, heads off the floor.

He's suddenly standing in her way. Smiling that distant smile.

CORDELIA
What do you want?
It's the old attitude, but she's not fooling anyone.

He takes her hand, starts leading her onto the floor.

CORDELIA
Hey! Hello, caveman-brain! What do you think
you're doing?
He turns back to her, smiles winningly.

JESSE
Shut up.
Brings her to the middle of the floor and starts dancing with her. He holds her, hardly touching her, moving slowly.

CORDELIA
Just this one dance...
She moves closer to him.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE: THE DOOR

The BOUNCER is suddenly confronted with the vampire group. Their faces are mostly in shadow.

BOUNCER
I need ID.
(as they start past him)
Hey! Nobody goes inside until I see --
Luke stands over him. His face inches from the Bouncer's.

LUKE
Get inside.
The Bouncer complies instantly.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - A MOMENT LATER

Once inside, the vampires spread out, each heading for an exit. Two of them stay behind and close off the front.

Darla heads for the door by the stage that leads backstage. Goes in.

One goes to the bar -- swings over it and stands in front of the door.

One heads upstairs.

And Luke climbs up on stage.

CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Darla checks that the exit door is secure. Then she goes over to the fuse box, flips a switch.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

The main lights and the music go off. There are GASPS, MURMURS. A voice from the stage calls out:

LUKE
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no cause for alarm.
On stage, a single spot continues to shine. Luke steps into the light. His face is rivetingly awful.

LUKE
Actually, there is cause for alarm. It just won't
do any good.
Major GASPS and MURMURS at the sight of him.

ANGLE: THE FRONT DOOR

A couple tries to get out. The vampire standing guard -- his normal face gone -- shakes his head no.

They shrink back from him.

ANGLE: CORDELIA

She stares at the stage, Jesse's hands still on her.

CORDELIA
I thought there wasn't any band tonight.
She looks at Jesse to see his face has changed as well. Starts to struggle but he holds her, pulls her back into the dark under the stairs.

ANGLE: DARLA

re-emerges from backstage. Looks up at Luke on stage.

LUKE
This is a glorious night. It's also the last one
any of you shall ever see.
(beat)
Bring me the first!
One of the vampires pushes the Bouncer up on stage.

BOUNCER
What do you guys want, you want money? Man,
what's wrong with your faces?
Luke grabs him by the scruff on the neck, squeezing any further conversation out of him.

LUKE
Watch me, people!
(to the Bouncer)
Their fear is elixir. It's almost like blood.
As he brings the Bouncer to him and bites his neck, sucking the life out of him in huge gulps.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

The Master stands, power coursing through him -- visibly. It lights him up.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Luke continues feeding. After a bit he pulls his head back, throws the Bouncer's dead body from him.

LUKE
Next!
CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Buffy and the others run up to the front door. She tries it -- it's locked.

BUFFY
It's locked.
GILES
We're too late.

BUFFY
Well, I didn't know I was gonna get grounded!

XANDER
(re: door)
Can you break it down?

BUFFY
Not this thing. You guys try the back entrance. 
I'll find my own way.

GILES
Right.
(to Xander and Willow)
Come on.

BUFFY
Guys!

They stop. Buffy hands them her bag of tricks.

INT. THE BRONZE

They are really scared now, seeing corpses (two now) lying before them. There is some screaming, some whimpering.

ANGLE: CORNER UNDER THE STAIRS

Darla is having a face off with Jesse, who holds Cordelia.

JESSE
This one's mine.
DARLA
They are all for the Master.

JESSE
I don't get one?

ANGLE: UPSTAIRS WINDOW BY THE BALCONY

The window opens slowly, an oblivious vampire before it. Buffy slips in.

She looks down at the stage, at Luke.

LUKE
I feel him rising! I need another!
She sees the three-pointed star on his head.

BUFFY
(to herself)
The Vessel...
The vampire turns, hearing this. He grabs Buffy, dragging her up to he middle of the balcony to present her to Luke.

LUKE
Tonight in his ascension. Tonight will be History
at its end! Yours is a glorious sacrifice.
Degradation most holy.
(looking around)
What, no volunteers?
Darla emerges, holding Cordelia.

DARLA
Here's a pretty one.
CORDELIA
Noooo...

Darla drags her toward the stage, hands her over to Luke.

ANGLE: BUFFY

slips out of the vampire's grasp and THROWS him off the balcony. He lands WHAM on his back right in front of the stage.

Silence.

BUFFY
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you in the middle something.
LUKE
YOU!

BUFFY
You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?

LUKE
(smiles)
I hoped you'd come.

CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

The exit door bursts open, a metal pipe-wielding Giles behind it. He starts in, the other two behind him.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

A vampire comes at Buffy from the side and she grabs him, THROWS him into the hookah pit.

He scrambles back up and she FLIPS herself over backwards, goes through the hole and lands on top of the pool table. A cue is lying on the table -- she does a hand spring and lands on the floor holding on the cue.

A vampire rushes her from the side --

ANGLE: BUFFY

without looking, she JAMS the cue end into his heart. We don't see him -- we just hear the PLUNGE. And when Buffy lets go, the cue stays right where it is.

BUFFY
Okay, Vessel-boy. You want blood?
She steps forward just as the cue rises like the arm of a guard gate and we hear the vampire's body THUD to the floor.

LUKE
I want yours. Only yours.
BUFFY
Then come and get it.

Cordelia, seeing her chance, tries to break free of Luke's grasp. He throws her to one side --

--and Buffy runs, LEAPS at him, slams her fist into his face. This one really hurts, and he stumbles back in pain.

He comes back at her but she ducks, comes back up with a roundhouse kick to the face. Another score.

She ships out her stake, comes at him -- but he blocks. Nails her in the face, and she skids into the corner, badly hurt. The stake falls at his feet.

ANGLE: DOOR TO BACKSTAGE

It bursts open, Xander nearly falling out.

He looks about him -- no vampires in the immediate vicinity -- and beings herding people out.

XANDER
Come on!
CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

The people rush past Willow and Giles, who push them towards the exit.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Buffy kicks Luke in the chest. He flies back, landing hard. She's about to go in for the kill when she sees.

ANGLE: A VAMPIRE

going for Xander, who's too busy shepherding people out to notice.

Buffy turns to the drum kit and kicks the cymbal right off the stand. She catches it in mid air --

--the vampire reaches Xander, grabs him--

--Buffy hurls the cymbal, frisbee style--

--the vampire turns, eyes wide, and the cymbal flies straight at his neck--

As he hears the SLICE, his eyes follow the trajectory of the liberated head.

XANDER
(softly)
Heads up...
ANGLE: BUFFY

barely has time to turn before Luke GRABS her from behind, lifting her up in a crushing bear hug.

ANGLE: XANDER

He is going to help Buffy when he hears a SHRIEK, turns and sees:

ANGLE: CORDELIA

is being dragged off into the area below the stairs by Jesse.

He throws her to the ground, kneeling above her. Pinning her.

JESSE
Hold still! You're not helping.
Xander appears behind Jesse, holding a stake. He could plunge it right through the back into the heart, but he hesitates.

XANDER
Jesse, man... don't make me do it.
Jesse looks around, grinning inhumanly.

JESSE
Buddy...
ANGLE: BUFFY

Is failing to get out of Luke's grasp. He squeezes even harder and she beings to lose consciousness.

LUKE
I've always wanted to kill a Slayer...
CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

People are still rushing out.

GILES
Come on! We've got to open the front as well!
He heads for the door to the main room and Darla JUMPS on him, digging for his throat. His stake is knocked out of his hand as he topples to the ground.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Xander takes a step back as Jesse rises, faces him.

XANDER
Jesse, I know there's still a part of you in
there.
JESSE
(exasperated)
Okay, let's deal with this. Jesse was an 
excruciating loser who couldn't get a date with 
anyone in the sighted community! Look at me now!
I'm a new man!

He grabs Xander and HURLS him against the wall. Xander falls in a heap to the cowering Cordelia.

JESSE
See, the old Jesse would have reasoned with you.
CUT TO:
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Willow frantically digs through Buffy's bag, looking for a weapon. She pulls out the jar of holy water.

Darla continues to struggle with Giles -- has him pinned on the ground.

WILLOW (O.S.)
Get off him!
Darla turns to face Willow and is DOUSED with holy water right in the face.

SCREAMING, she brings her hands to her face, smoke pouring out from between her fingers.

Giles pushes her off him, getting up to face her. But Darla is already stumbling out the exit in smoking agony.

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Buffy is limp in Luke's grasp. Head dangling forward.

LUKE
Master, taste of this and be free.
He opens wide, leans in -- and Buffy HEADBUTTS him with the back of her head, sends him staggering back.

BUFFY
How'd it taste?
She is weak, despite her bravado. She grabs the cymbal stand, holds it as a weapon. Looks around her -- and sees:

ANGLE: THE WINDOW

at the back of the stage. It's painted black, one huge pane.

Buffy looks at it, at Luke.

ANGLE: XANDER

Jesse picks him up again, fury etching his demon face.

JESSE
I'm sick of you getting in the way, you know?
Cordelia, she's gonna live forever. You're not.
Xander holds the stake up to Jesse's chest, determined but scared.

JESSE
Oh, right! Put me out of my misery! You don't
have the g--
And a fleeing woman SLAMS into Jesse from behind, driving him onto the stake. He drags himself on a stunned Xander, dying.

And then he's dust. Xander barely has time to react before two more vampires grab him.

ANGLE: BUFFY

She swings the cymbal stand at an approaching Luke. He smiles.

LUKE
You forget. Metal can't hurt me.
BUFFY
There's something you forgot about, too.

He hesitates, doubt clouding his face.

BUFFY
Sunrise.
And she takes the stand and HURLS it right through the plate glass window at the back of the stage -- SHATTERING the entire thing.

ANGLE: LUKE

As the warm light STREAMS IN on him, he SCREAMS, raises his hands --

--and stops. Puzzled.

Buffy DRIVES the stake in through his back. He arches forward, in real agony this time.

BUFFY
It's in about nine hours, moron.
ANGLE: THE BROKEN WINDOW

And Luke realizes the light from the window is merely a streetlight, shining in the darkness.

Luke stumbles forward--

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

And the Master stumbles forward in the exact same position, the bright energy beginning to fade from him. He reaches out, nearly doubled over --

QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

The last of the energy fades from the master.

THE MASTER
(weakly)
Nooooo....
He falls to his knees, reaches out blindly for support.

What he touches is the wall, once again too strong for him to bend. Fury and despair cross hi face as he looks up at it. A scream wells up inside him, and right before it bellows out, we

CUT TO:
INT. THE BRONZE - CONTINUOUS

Xander struggles with the remaining vampires, who hold him, their attention on the stage.

Buffy looks down at the spot where Luke's body was. After a moment, she turns her gaze slowly toward the vampires.

They look at the expression on her face for about 1/8th of a second, then they drop Xander and bolt out of the front door.

ANGLE: THE BACKSTAGE DOOR

Giles and Willow come slowly out, meet Buffy and Xander in the middle of the dance floor.

GILES
I take it it's over.
WILLOW
Did we win?

A moment, as they look about at the carnage that surrounds them. Most of the patrons have fled, though some remain, stunned and silent.

BUFFY
Well, we averted the apocalypse. You gotta give
us points for that.
ANGLE: CORDELIA

Sitting right where Jesse left her. Not a word.

XANDER
One thing's for sure. Nothing is ever gonna be
the same.
CUT TO:
EXT. FOUNTAIN QUAD - DAY

Everything is exactly the same. We see kids milling about, talking, laughing in the bright sunshine. Pick up Cordelia, walking by with her friends.

CORDELIA
Well, I heard it was rival gangs. Anyway, Buffy
totally knew these guys which is too weird. I
can't remember anything too well, but I'm telling
you, it was a freak show.
GIRL
Oh, I wish I'd been there.

And we leave them, picking up Buffy and the others nearby, crossing the other way. Xander has a look of disbelief on his face.

BUFFY
Well, what exactly were you expecting?
XANDER
I don't know! Something. The dead rose! We
should've at least had an assembly.

GILES
People have a tendency to rationalize what they
can, and forget what they can't.

BUFFY
Believe me, I've seen it happen.

WILLOW
Well, I'll never forget it. None of it.

GILES
Good. Next time you'll be prepared.

XANDER
Next time?

WILLOW
Next time is why?

GILES
We stopped the master from freeing himself and
opening the mouth of Hell. Doesn't mean he'll
stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.

WILLOW
More vampires?

GILES
Not just vampires. The next creature we face may
be something quite different.

BUFFY
I can hardly wait.

GILES
We're at a center of mystical convergence here.
We may in fact stand between the earth and total
destruction.

XANDER
Buffy, this isn't good.

BUFFY
Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I
can still get kicked out of school.

She smiles at Giles and starts off, the other two keeping up with her.

XANDER
Hey, that's a plan. 'Cause a lot of schools 
aren't on Hellmouths.
WILLOW
Maybe you could blow something up. They're really 
strict about that.

BUFFY
I was aiming for a subtle approach, like
excessive not studying.

Giles watches them go, an uneasy smile plastered on his lips.

GILES
The earth is doomed.
BLACK OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING


GILES (V.O)
This is madness.
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

GILES, deeply concerned, is staring at someone we can't see.

WIDEN TO REVEAL BUFFY, in cute CHEERLEADING OUTFIT

BUFFY
You don't like the color.
GILES
I what? I don't -- Buffy, do you
ignore everything I say? As a
rule?

BUFFY
No, I believe that's your trick. I
told you I'm going out for the
cheerleading squad.

GILES
You have a sacred birthright,
Buffy. You have been chosen to
destroy Vampires, not wave pom-poms
at people. As the Watcher, I
forbid it.

BUFFY
And you'll be stopping me how?

GILES
Dyeh, uh, well -- by appealling to
your common sense, if such a
creature exists.

BUFFY
I'll still have time to fight the
forces of evil, okay? But I want
to have a life. I want to do
something normal. Something safe.

CUT TO:
INT. ATTIC - DAY

The windows have been boarded and taped over -- tiny pinpricks of sunlight stream in to this otherwise dark place. Whatever this place is, it's not safe.

A figure moves about before us in a black, hooded robe. It pauses before a bubbling cauldron, then crosses to a shelf.

On the shelf is a doll in a cheerleading outfit. Her hands have been wrapped with bits of cloth.

The figure reaches out and takes the doll. We HOLD on the empty shelf.

CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - DAY

CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS reads a sign on the wall. Big banner showing the FIGHTING SUNNYDALE RAZORBACKS hangs next to it.

PRETTY GIRLS, in short skirts, twirl and warm up.

Buffy enters with WILLOW and XANDER.

WILLOW
Giles didn't approve, huh?
BUFFY
He totally lost his water. We
haven't even seen a vampire in a
week. I'd say he should get a
girlfriend if he wasn't so old.

WILLOW
Well, we're behind you.

XANDER
People scoff at things like school
spirit -- but when you see these
young women giving their all like
this...

AMBER, an attractive, agile girl, her feet on two chairs, slides down into an extra low split.

XANDER
(mesmerized)
...Oooh, stretchy. Where was I?
WILLOW
You were pretending that seeing
scantily-clad girls in revealing
postures was a spiritual
experience.

XANDER
What do you mean, pretending?

Xander pulls out an I.D. bracelet.

XANDER
Oh, hey. Here's a little good luck
thing for the tryouts...
BUFFY
(charmed)
What is this?

WILLOW
(less charmed)
What is that?

Buffy takes the bracelet, puts it on.

BUFFY
This is so sweet!
(reads on bracelet:)
"Yours always..."
XANDER
That was on there when I got it.
Really. They all said that.

CORDELIA, in cheerleader outfit, moves up, watches Amber stand on one leg and hold the other straight up in the air.

CORDELIA
Just look at Amber. Who does she
think she is, a Laker Girl?
WILLOW
I heard she turned them down.

A SENIOR CHEERLEADER (Cordelia two years hence) moves to the judge's table with two other SENIOR CHEERLEADERS.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Let's begin with...
(reads from list)
Amber Grove. If you're not
auditioning move off the floor.
Xander, Willow, Buffy, Cordelia move back. Willow spots AMY MADISON (in cheerleader outfit), nice girl, a little tightly wound today.

WILLOW
Hi Amy.
AMY
Hi.

WILLOW
I didn't know you wanted to be a
cheerleader. You lost a lot of
weight.

AMY
Had to.

WILLOW
Do you know Buffy?

AMY
Hi.
(to Buffy)
Oh how I hate this, let me count
the ways.

Buffy smiles, warming to Amy's honesty.

They watch Amber's routine -- she's really good.

AMY
She trained with Benson -- he's the
best coach money can buy.
BUFFY
They have cheerleading coaches?

AMY
Oh yeah. You don't have...? I train
with my mom, three hours in the
morning, three at night.

BUFFY
That kind of quality time with my
mom would probably lead to some
quality matricide.

AMY
(smiles)
I know it's kinda hokey... but
she's really great.

Cordelia, standing nearby, feigns boredom with Amber's performance, turns her back.

Everyone else watches Amber as SMOKE BEGINS TO EMANATE from her pom-poms.

BUFFY
What the ... ?
WILLOW
That girl's on fire.

CORDELIA
(back still turned)
Enough with the hyperbole.

Amber stops, drops the pom-poms. The smoke is coming from her - and her hands and forearms suddenly burst into FLAMES! Amber SCREAMS! (as do other girls.) Buffy vaults to the large RAZORBACKS BANNER, rips it down and tackles Amber, wrapped her tightly in it and smothering the flames.

BUFFY
(to Amber)
It's okay, you're gonna be okay...
Off Buffy,

BLACK OUT.
END OF TEASER
Act One
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

The foursome are gathered.


BUFFY
I've been slaying Vampires for more
than a year now. I've seen some
pretty cringeworthy stuff, but
nobody's hands ever got toasted.
GILES
I imagine not.

BUFFY
So this is not a vampire problem.

GILES
No.

BUFFY
But it is funky, right? Not of
the norm?

GILES
Quite. Spontaneous human
combustion is rare, and
scientifically unexplainable. But
there've been cases reported for
hundreds of years. Usually all
that's left is a pile of ashes.

WILLOW
That's all that would have been
left of Amber if it hadn't been for
Buffy.

XANDER
So we have no idea what caused
this? That's a comfort.

GILES
Well, that is the thrill of living
on a hellmouth -- one has a
veritable cornucopia of fiends,
devils and ghouls to engage --
(off their looks)
Pardon me for finding the glass
half full.

BUFFY
Any common denominator in cases of
spontaneous combustion?

GILES
Rage. In most cases the person who
combusted was terribly angry or
upset.

XANDER
So maybe Amber's got this power.
To make herself be on fire. Like
the Human Torch, only it hurts.

BUFFY
So I should get the skinny on
Amber. See if she's had any
colorful episodes before.

WILLOW
That means hacking illegally into
the school's computer system -- at
last something I can do.

She moves to a computer.

XANDER
I'll ask around about her.
BUFFY
Guys, you don't have to get
involved.

XANDER
What do you mean? We're a team!
Aren't we a team?

WILLOW
Yeah, you're the Slayer and we're
like the slayerettes.

BUFFY
I don't want you putting yourselves
in danger.

XANDER
I laugh in the face of danger.
Then I hide till it goes away.

BUFFY
Okay, well, I'm psyched for the
help.
(to Giles)
And what if we find out Amber
didn't cause this herself?

GILES
Then we will have to determine who
or what did. And deal with it
accordingly.

XANDER
(off Buffy's worried
look)
Hey, we've fought vampires!
Anything else'll be a walk in the
park.

BUFFY
I hope so...

CUT TO:
INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

There are crates strewn about. Joyce is opening them with a crowbar (and some difficulty).

Buffy enters, throws her books on the kitchen table.

BUFFY
Hey, Mom.
JOYCE
Hi. How was school?

BUFFY
A reverent joy. What's all this?

JOYCE
It's for the tribal art display.

Buffy picks up a statue, looks at it.

BUFFY
Oh. Cool.
She sits down on the table, grabbing a donut. Watches Joyce a minute -- Joyce hasn't looked back at her -- before offering:

BUFFY
We had tryouts today.
JOYCE
Great! How'd it go?

BUFFY
Well, I didn't get to try out yet.
There was an accident. Pretty fierce
competition, though.

JOYCE
I know you'll do fine. Keep on
plugging. Just have to get back on
the horse.

Joyce tries to pry open the crate on the table next to Buffy. It won't budge.

BUFFY
Mom?
JOYCE
(finally looking around)
Yeah?

BUFFY
What was I trying out for?

JOYCE
(stops, stumped)
Um... some activity? I have no
idea, I'm sorry.

BUFFY
That's okay. Your platitudes are
good for all occasions.

JOYCE
I'm distracted. I've got a lot of
inventory to go through here. This
is my gallery's first major show.

She gives up, turns to another crate.

JOYCE
It might not physically kill you to
give me a hand...
Buffy casually flips the lid off the unopenable crate with one hand.

BUFFY
It was cheerleading tryouts.
JOYCE
Oh! Good. I'm glad you're taking
that up again. Keep you out of
trouble.

BUFFY
I'm not in trouble, mom.

JOYCE
No, not yet. I mean -- you stopped
cheerleading right before the
trouble. So it's good you're going
back --

She pulls a statue of a man halfway out of a crate, stops.

JOYCE
Oh, dear.
She puts it back.

BUFFY
What is it?
JOYCE
Fertility statue. You don't need
to see it.

Buffy heads for the fridge. Looking in:

BUFFY
You know, this girl Amy trains with
her mom like three hours a day.
(closes the fridge)
Sounds like her mom's really into
it.
JOYCE
(Absently)
Sounds like her mom doesn't have a
whole lot to do.

She exits, carrying a couple of pieces. Buffy watches her a moment, then looks down into the crate with the fertility statue. Her eyes go wide.

BUFFY
Jeepers.

EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING

SENIOR CHEERLEADER (O.S.)
Despite the terrible thing that
happened yesterday...
INT. THE GYM - DAY

Cheerleader tryouts. Buffy, Amy, Cordelia (wearing pink headband) and ten or twelve others.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
...we still have to pick new
cheerleaders. If you make the team,
you'll find your name posted in the
Quad after lunch. Let's begin with
group performance -- Cordelia,
Buffy, Amy, Morgan, Janice and
Lishanne.
LISHANNE is an attractive African American. The five girls walk to the center of the gym. Amy glares at her hands.

AMY
Why do my hands have to sweat when
I get nervous?
BUFFY
Don't worry, you'll do great.

MUSIC UP. The girls perform a group cheer (to be choreographed.)

It includes synchronized leaps, twirls and basketball cheer, ala:

LISHANNE
We're Sunnydale, Sunnydale
GROUP CHEER
We Never Fail, Never Fail

LISHANNE
Jump and Shoot, Swish and Score

GROUP CHEER
The Other Team Is Such a Bore
YEAHHH!

Morgan is okay. Lishanne is great. Cordelia is surprisingly good, as is Buffy, still a little rusty but impressive.

Amy starts out well but tries too hard -- misses a couple of synchronized moves -- and, in the big finish (each girl doing a cartwheel and sliding to their knees one at a time) AMY'S HANDS slip on the floor, and she careens into:

CORDELIA
(to judges)
You saw that, right? That wasn't
me.
CUT TO:
INT. GYM FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Amy, in cheerleader outfit, depressed, stands before a big trophy display case (includes cheerleader trophies and photos).

Buffy, dressed for school, exits locker room, moves up. Looks at CHEERLEADER PHOTO. Under the photo, it reads: 1977 -- TRI-COUNTY BEST.

AMY
That's my mom.
BUFFY
No...
(reads name)
Catherine Madison. Get down with
your bad self.

AMY
Her nickname was Catherine The
Great: she took that team and made
them tri-county champions, no one's
ever done that before or since. She
and my dad were homecoming King and
Queen, got married right after
graduation.

BUFFY
That's kinda romantic.

AMY
Well... he was a big loser,
couldn't make any money, took off
with Miss Trailer Trash when I was
twelve.

BUFFY
Okay, that part's less romantic.
My folks split up, too.

AMY
Drag, huh. He left my mom with
nothing. She put herself through
cosmetology school, bought me
everything I ever wanted and never
gained a single pound...

BUFFY
She sounds great, Amy, but that
doesn't mean you have to, you know,
lock step as far as the
cheerleading thing --

Amy turns to Buffy, eyes filling.

AMY
It's just, she was the best, and I
can't get my body to move like
hers. I choked in there so bad.
Amy looks very sad and forlorn as Willow enters. She tries to put on a brave face, heads for the GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM.

AMY
...I gotta get changed...
WILLOW
(to Amy's departing back)
Hi Amy...
(to Buffy)
She okay?

BUFFY
She's wiggin' about her mother...
(re: photo)
...the big cheer queen back when.

WILLOW
Yeah. Her mom's kinda...

BUFFY
Nazi-like?

WILLOW
Heil. If she gains an ounce she
padlocks the fridge and won't eat
anything but broth.

BUFFY
So Mommie Dearest is really...
Mommie Dearest.

WILLOW
There's a bitter streak -- but
Amy's nice. We used to hang in
Junior High. When her mom'd go on a
broth kick Amy'd come to my house
and we'd just stuff ourselves with
brownies.

BUFFY
Any word on Amber?

WILLOW
(pulls paper from
bookbag)
Nothing thrilling. Average student
-- got detention once for
smoking -- regular smoking, with a
cigarette. Not being smoky. All
pretty normal.

BUFFY
We'll just have to see what happens
next. Maybe nothing will.

They head out.

CUT TO:
INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY

MOVING CREEPY-CAM through the dimly lit room. Past the cold floors, the metal lockers...

Amy, alone, changes into her school clothes. Her movements are slow and tired. She rubs an aching shoulder -- hears a NOISE, whips her head around. HER POV - The empty locker room. Spooky. A lone shower DRIPS.

She instinctively does up a couple of buttons on her blouse, as if to protect herself, turning slowly around in a circle -- and suddenly

CORDELIA IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HER

Amy jumps, frightened. Cordelia is perfectly dressed and coiffed. She holds the pink headband she wore during auditions. She speaks very quietly and in a chillingly kind voice, gesturing very close to Amy's face with the headband.

CORDELIA
I have a dream. It's me on the
Cheerleading Squad, adored by every
Varsity male as far as the eye can
see. We have to achieve our dreams,
Amy, otherwise we wither and die.
AMY
Look, I'm sorry about --

CORDELIA
Shhh. If your supreme klutziness
out there today takes me out of the
running you are going to be so very
beyond sorry. Have a nice day.

Cordelia hurls the headband into her own locker and SLAMS IT! She walks out -- her locker swinging back open. Amy takes a breath, watching Cordelia's departing back.

CUT TO:
EXT. QUAD DAY

Kids mill about after lunch. Xander and Willow walk through them.

WILLOW
I told Buffy about Amber.
XANDER
Cool. Was she wearing it?
(off her look)
The bracelet. She was wearing it,
right? That's pretty much like
we're going out.

WILLOW
Except without the hugging or
kissing or her knowing about it.

XANDER
So now I'm a figure of fun. I
should just ask, right?

WILLOW
Won't know till you ask.

XANDER
See, this is why you're cool.
You're like a guy. You're my guy
friend that knows about girl stuff.

WILLOW
Oh great. I'm a guy.

He sees the Senior Cheerleader moving towards the bulletin board, list in hand. Girls begin to gather.

XANDER
Hey, they're posting the list!
He bolts for:

EXT. QUAD - BULLETIN BOARD - DAY

A sizable crowd has gathered. The Senior Cheerleader posts the list and goes. Girls stand on tiptoe, push and poke, trying to see. Buffy and Amy are on the periphery as Xander and Willow move up. A GIRL IN TEARS breaks out of the crowd, runs off. Lishanne, reading the list, jumps up and down with some friends.

LISHANNE
Yess!
AMY
I can't take this...

Buffy tries to wedge into the crowd but TWO CONTENDERS step right in front of her.

XANDER
Spot me, I'm goin' in.
Xander takes a little dive into the throng, works his way to the front where he finds himself nose to nose with Cordelia at the list. He lets her check it out first.

XANDER
Women and children first.
ANGLE - EDGE OF THRONG

Cordelia emerges, triumphant.

CORDELIA
(to Amy)
You're lucky.
AMY
I made it?

CORDELIA
I made it.

Cordelia moves off; Xander, rubbing his arm, emerges from the throng.

XANDER
One of those girls hit me really
hard -- we have to start testing
for steroids --
(to Buffy and Amy)
-- okay, not only did you make it,
but you, Miss Summers, are the
number one alternate and Amy's the
number three!
Amy's face falls, she turns and walks off.

XANDER
Any what better way to celebrate
than with a romantic drive-through
for two at --
WILLOW
Xander, alternates are the ones who
didn't make the team. They only
fill in if something happens to the
ones who did.

BUFFY
(moving after Amy)
Excuse me.

XANDER
For I am Xander, King of the
Cretins, and all lesser cretins
must bow before me.

ANGLE - AMY, TRYING TO CONTROL HER FEELINGS

As Buffy moves up.

BUFFY
At least it's over. And you know
what I think we should do about it?
Brownie pig-out, my house, now.
AMY
How many more hours a day can I
practice? How much more can I do?
This would never have happened to
my mom. Never.

Amy takes off. Buffy watches her go.

EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY

A Sunnydale two story, a little darker and foreboding than the others on the street. WE PUSH in on the house, moving up towards the attic window.

INT. AMY'S ATTIC - DAY

Creepy, dark and strange. Walls adorned with witch and warlock paraphernalia. Burning black candles.

The floor is dominated by a large hand-painted pentagram on top of which sits the classic black iron cauldron, hideous bubbling brew cooking inside.

A HAND ENTERS FRAME drops a serpent's head into the brew. We don't see the robed WITCH'S face but we (dimly) HEAR HER CHANTING.

WITCH
...Lord of Darkness, Lord of
Night... accept they supplicant's
sacrifice...
The Witch moves to a ROW OF DOLLS neatly lined up on the wall. Pretty dolls, Barbie-types.

The hand picks up a brunette doll. The hand brings the doll to the cauldron. We now see CORDELIA'S PINK HEAD BAND in the Witch's other hand. The CHANTING grows more intense as the pink headband is wrapped round and round the Cordelia doll's face, tighter and tighter.

WITCH
...reap thy vengeance with keen and
cruel might... send thy sudden
darkness out of darkest night.
And the hand drops the Cordelia doll in the brew. The pink headband soaks up the foul-colored liquid and the little doll sinks from sight.

BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT ONE
Act Two
INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN - MORNING

Buffy is getting her books together. Joyce enters carrying an old yearbook.


JOYCE
Look what I found! It's my old
yearbook, from junior year. Oh,
look, there I am.
Buffy looks for a second.

BUFFY
Mom, I accepted that you've had
sex. I'm not ready to know you've
had Farrah hair.
JOYCE
This is Gidget hair. Don't they
teach you anything in history?

BUFFY
That's cool. I gotta book --

JOYCE
Well I was thinking, I mean I know
the cheerleading thing didn't work
out. Maybe you should think about
joining the yearbook staff. I did
it, and it was a lot of fun.

BUFFY
Not really my tip, mom.

JOYCE
I was photo editor. I got to be on
every page. Made me look much more
popular than I was.

BUFFY
Have you seen the kids who do
yearbook, mom? Nerds pick on
them.

JOYCE
Some of the best times I had in
school were working on the
yearbook.

BUFFY
This just in: I'm not you. I'm
into my own thing.

JOYCE
Your own thing, whatever it is, got
you kicked out of school. And we
had to move here to find a decent
school that would take you.

Quite frankly, ouch. The sting hangs in the air before Buffy grabs her books and walks out.

JOYCE
Honey...
Joyce stands there a moment, upset with herself.

JOYCE
Great parenting form. Little shaky
on the dismount...
CUT TO:
EXT. SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

Cordelia, walking more slowly and regally than usual, passes Xander and Willow (pen in mouth).

XANDER
(to Cordelia)
Morning your Highness, beheadings
at noon as usual?
(to Willow, re:
Cordelia's departing
back).
Okay, see how she has now clue I'm
even a mammal, much less a human
being?
WILLOW
None.

XANDER
This invisible man syndrome, a
blessing in Cordelia's case, a
curse in Buffy's.

WILLOW
You're not invisible to Buffy.

XANDER
Worse, I'm just part of the
scenery, like an old shoe, or a rug
you walk on every day but you never
really see --

WILLOW
(trying to be helpful)
-- like a pen that's all chewed up
and you know you should throw it
away but you don't, not 'cause you
really like it that much but more
'cause you're just so used to it
and --

XANDER
Will. That is the point and let's
not drive it through my head like a
railroad spike. What I have do --
what I'm going to do -- is just
what you said --

WILLOW
Throw away the pen, forget about
Buffy.
(tosses pen in trash)

XANDER
What I have to do -- what I'm going
to do -- is be a man and ask her
out. No more i.d. bracelets, subtle
innuendo, or Polaroids outside her
bedroom window late at night --
that last is a joke to relieve the
tension because here she comes.

Buffy rounds a corner, heading their way.

WILLOW
I know I'm relieved.
XANDER
Alright. Into battle I go. would
you ask her out for me? No. Man.
Me. Battle.

ANGLE - BUFFY

Passing Cordelia at her locker. Buffy sees Cordelia reach for her combination -- her fingers miss it, find it. Buffy moves on, is intercepted by:

XANDER
Buffy, how would you like to...
BUFFY
(looking back)
Is that even Cordelia's locker?

XANDER
Huh? I don't know, what I'm saying
here is, accompany me Friday
night...

Buffy, not really listening, sees Cordelia give up on the locker which won't open for her, walk off.

BUFFY
Hang on, Xander, I have to... we
can pick this up later, you don't
mind, do you?
As she turns and goes. He watches her. A small high-pitched sound builds slowly in the back of his throat -- the sound of a plan going down, down, down.

XANDER
(explosion)
Pplllewww!
CUT TO:
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Cordelia, still moving more slowly than usual, makes her way across campus.

Buffy exits a building fifty yards or so behind Cordelia. Follows her, concerned.

EXT. DRIVER'S ED - DAY

Orange cones are set up in a little course on the blacktop. A DRIVER'S ED car, MR. POLE, the beleaguered TEACHER, two STUDENTS. Cordelia walks up.

MR. POLE
Nice of you to join us Cordelia. We
didn't keep you waiting or anything
did we? It's your turn to drive.
Let's buckle up, people.
Pole and students move to the car.

CORDELIA
I don't want to drive today, Mr.
Pole.
Mr. Pole looks wildly uncomfortable for a beat, then:

MR. POLE
You've flunked Driver's Ed twice -
show me some moves or you'll be
taking the bus to college.
Cordelia marches to the car, climbs behind the wheel.

ANGLE - BUFFY

Moving up, keeping an eye on Cordelia.

EXT.\INT. DRIVER'S ED CAR - DAY

Mr. Pole buckles up in the passenger seat.

MR. POLE
Check your brake, your mirrors,
start the engine, put the car in
drive...
ANGLE - CORDELIA

Tight on her face, looking at the

GEAR SHIFT INDICATOR

It's a big blur. This girl is having trouble seeing.

MR. POLE
...let' move forward and through
the cones in a gentle, even turn to
the --
Cordelia puts the car in REVERSE, steps on the gas. The car jerks backwards, knocking into a pole.

MR. POLE
-- brakes!
Cordelia slams on the brakes, jams the car through every gear until she finds drive, hits the gas.

The car SCREECHES forward.

MR. POLE
Slow down, turn right, right,
BRAKES, BRAKES!!
Cordelia does as she's told, yanking the wheel, stomping on the brakes.

Cordelia's car launches into a nasty skid, right off the blacktop, onto the grass, careening out of control now towards the street.

Buffy starts running like hell.

Mr. Pole and the KIDS IN BACK SCREAM bloody murder.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Cordelia's car skids into the street and stops. A car swerves around them, tires squealing, HORN BLARING.

MR. POLE
Everyone out!
Cordelia, Pole, the students scramble out. Mr. Pole and the students run. Cordelia looks around, completely disoriented.

CORDELIA'S POV

Dark and murky, dimmest shape of a UPS size truck bearing down on her. She takes a step away, then another -- in about five seconds she's going to be hamburger.

BUFFY

Tears across the grass onto the sidewalk.

CORDELIA
Screams, terrified, expecting the worst.

THE TRUCK

Hits its breaks, heading right at Cordelia.

BUFFY

Leaps on a parked car, using it as a booster to send her AIRBORNE.

BUFFY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, TACKLES CORDELIA

Carrying her out of harm's way as the truck screeches past.

CORDELIA AND BUFFY

On the ground.

CORDELIA
What's happening?!? I can't see
anything!
BUFFY
Cordelia, it's okay, you're gonna
be -- Oh, god...

Buffy looks at Cordelia whose EYES GLAZE OVER TO MURKY WHITE.

CORDELIA
What's happening to me!?!
CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

CLOSE ON GILES

GILES
Witchcraft. Blinding your enemy to
disable and disorient them is a
classic.
ANGLE - Buffy, Xander, Willow. Giles holds a witchcraft text. We see AN ENGRAVING of SCARY WITCHES in SACRED CIRCLE in the woods.

XANDER
First vampires, now witches... no
wonder you can still afford a house
in Sunnydale.
GILES
Why would someone want to harm
Cordelia?

WILLOW
Maybe because... they met her. Did
I say that?

GILES
Then why was Amber set ablaze?

XANDER
Yeah, those guys don't hang.

BUFFY
They're both cheerleaders.

GILES
Someone doesn't like cheerleading.

BUFFY
Or likes it too much.

WILLOW
Amy.

BUFFY
Amy.

XANDER
So you guys are leaning towards
Amy.

BUFFY
She's desperate to get on that
team... I get the feeling she'd do
anything to make her mom's dream
come true.

GILES
Now I do want to make sure I've got
this right. This witch is casting
horrible, disfiguring spells so
that she can be a cheerleader.

BUFFY
Your point being?

GILES
Priorities. Really, if I had the
power of the black mass I'd set my
sights a little higher than making
the pep squad.

BUFFY
I think you're underestimating the
amount of pressure a parent can lay
on you. If you're not a picture
perfect carbon copy they tend to
wig.

WILLOW
Cheerleading was kind of her mom's
last hurrah.

XANDER
We still gotta stop Amy. We should
grab her before --

GILES
(flipping though text)
Let's be certain she's the witch
before we arouse her suspicions.
She's capable of some fairly ugly
things.

BUFFY
All right, you're a high school
girl, you're desperate to make the
team and please your mom, you turn
to witchcraft. What's the first
thing you do?

WILLOW
check out the books on witchcraft!

Willow moves to the computer at check-out desk, scanning records.

XANDER
That's the last thing you do! You
don't leave a paper trail. Forget
that --
WILLOW
It'll just take a minute --

XANDER
We don't have a minute.
Cheerleaders' lives are in
danger -- Buffy's in danger.
(grabs Buffy, tries to
hustle her out)
You were the first alternate.
You're on the team now that
Cordelia's out -- you could be
next, we have to get you to a safe
house.

WILLOW
(sees something on
computer)
Xander...

XANDER
(innocent)
Yes?

WILLOW
"Witches - Historic Roots to Modern
Practice" checked out by Alexander
Harris.

BUFFY
(moves to computer)
"The Pagan Rites", checked out by
Alexander --

XANDER
All right, all right. It's not
what you think.

WILLOW
You like to look at the semi-nude
engravings?

XANDER
Oh. Well, then it is what you
think.

GILES
We'll need a conclusive test
anyway. There should be one - yes!
The ducking stool. We throw her in
the pond. If she floats, she's a
witch; if she drowns, she's
innocent.
(off their looks)
... some of my texts are a bit
outdated.

BUFFY
You think?

GILES
(looks in another book)
Ah! Yes. This should work.
You'll need some of her hair, a
little quicksilver and aqua fortis.

WILLOW
That's just mercury and nitric
acid, we can get it in the science
lab.

GILES
(reads)
"Heat ingredients and apply to
witch, if a spell has been cast in
previous forty-eight hours witch's
skin will turn blue." Oh, and
you'll need some eye of newt.

SMASH CUT TO:
A FROG - INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY

His big ol' eye looking up at us.

PULL BACK, revealing we are seeing this in a BIG MIRROR, mounted on the teacher's desk in front of the class. The mirror is so the students can see what DR. GREGORY (kindly, older) is doing. willow, Xander, Buffy, Lishanne and Amy are part of the class.

DR. GREGORY
Those on track one may begin their
dissections. Those on track two,
add your hydrochloric acid and
ammonium hydroxide to your
beakers...
He demonstrates, we see it in the big mirror. Smoke and gas. He holds up the smoky beaker.

ANGLE - WILLOW AND XANDER

At a large table. Xander holds a scalpel poised over a frog. He lowers the scalpel, then:

XANDER
I can't.
He puts the scalpel down. Willow takes it, makes (off camera) a quick neat incision.

WILLOW
One eye of newt...
XANDER
Wow, you've got a killer streak
I've never seen before. Hope I
never cross you.

WILLOW
I do too, then I'd have to carve
you up in neat little pieces.

She holds up the scalpel, gives him her sweet "Willow" smile.

XANDER
Ha ha.
(takes scalpel
respectfully)
How's Buffy coming with the hair?
ANGLE: BUFFY

Moving past Lishanne.

LISHANNE
(sarcastically)
Isn't this exciting?
BUFFY
(small laugh)
Oh yeah.

Buffy reaches Amy at another big desk with Bunsen burner, beakers, etc.

BUFFY
Help. Which is the hydrochloric
acid and which is the ammonium
hydroxide?
AMY
Well, the bottle that says
hydrochloric acid is usually the
hydrochloric acid.

BUFFY
Read the bottles -- what a concept.

Buffy drops her pen, bends down to pick it up, as she does, her hand slips INSIDE AMY'S purse, grabs some hair off Amy's brush.

ANGLE - BUFFY STRAIGHTENS UP

Amy's looking at her -- did she see the hair grab?

Buffy moves back to her seat (in front of Willow and Xander.) Keeping her back to them, she reaches back, drops the hair in front of Willow who adds it to a chemical mix on a Bunsen burner.

Amy glances at them.

XANDER
(through his teeth)
Smile and wave to the nice witch.
Willow hands the beaker to Buffy.

WILLOW
All set. You have a plan?
BUFFY
Spill it on her, try and make it
look natural.

XANDER
We'll be right behind you. Only
farther away.

Buffy heads for Amy's desk with beaker. As she does,

DR. GREGORY
Lishanne, can you tell me why these
chemicals have this reaction?
Buffy casually spills a drops or two on Amy's arm. Buffy looks at:

ANGLE - AMY'S ARM

The drops do turn blue, but we tilt up to see Amy's eyes locked on someone else.

ANGLE - LISHANNE

We see her from behind, starting to shake, to spaz out.

DR. GREGORY
Lishanne? Are you -- Oh my god.
She knocks a few beakers over as she stumblingly rises and turns, grabbing at the first thing she sees -- which is Amy. Amy is brought face to face with Lishanne -- WHO HAS NO MOUTH. Amy backs away, terrified by what she sees.

CUT TO:
INT. HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Our three are clustered, conferring.

XANDER
Did you see? Amy was as freaked
out as the rest of us.
WILLOW
So it's not her?

BUFFY
The test was positive. She's our
Sabrina. I just don't think she
realizes what she's doing.

WILLOW
Should we talk to her?

BUFFY
Maybe we should talk to her
mother. I wonder if she knows
what she's created.

CUT TO:
EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY

Pushing in on the house as Amy enters frame, marches up and through the front door.

INT. AMY'S HOUSE - DAY

Dark. Austere. Clean. Amy moves through, pissed. We haven't seen her like this before.

AMY
Where are you?!
Amy finds her mother, CATHERINE MADISON, late thirties, very well preserved, sitting in the blue light of the T.V. Catherine quickly flicks the T.V. off, like a kid caught doing something wrong.

AMY
Another productive day in front of
the T.V. I got a history report due
tomorrow. Write it.
Amy hurls her book bag on the couch next to her mother.

AMY
I should be on that team by now.
Instead, Miss Buffy and friends are
sneaking around stealing bits of my
hair.
CLOSE - AMY'S HAND

As she angrily dangles something from it -- the i.d. bracelet Xander gave Buffy. We're close enough to read "Yours Always".

AMY
I'll be upstairs.
Amy wraps her fingers around Buffy's bracelet, marches out.

BLACK OUT.

Act Three
INT. BUFFY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

We TRACK IN on Buffy sleeping.

ANGLE: ALARM CLOCK

It's one of the old fashioned round ones with the bell, and it starts RINGING.

Buffy lumps around under the cover, mewling in protest before she reaches for the clock.

She grabs it and casually CRUSHES it with her hand. Poles her head out from under the covers to look at what she has wrought.


BUFFY

Oops.

INT. BUFFY'S KITCHEN A BIT LATER

Joyce is making breakfast. Buffy comes in in a really good mood.

BUFFY

MACHO MACHO MAN... Hey, juice.
She downs an entire glass in one sip.

BUFFY
Quality juice. Not from
concentrate.
JOYCE
(tentatively)
You're in a good mood.

BUFFY
I am. I'm on the squad. Which is
great because I feel like cheering.
And leading others to cheer. Hey,
juice!

She downs Joyce's as well.

JOYCE
Listen honey, about yesterday...
BUFFY
That's totally yester. Besides,
it's not like you were wrong. I
did get kicked out. I'm wacky that
way.

JOYCE
Still, I want you to know that
despite the problems you've had --

BUFFY
Mom, you don't get it. Believe me,
you don't want it. There's just
things about being a vampire slayer
that the older generation has a
problem with.

JOYCE
A what?

BUFFY
Long story. I mean I'm kidding.

JOYCE
Buffy, are you feeling well?

BUFFY
I can't be in a good mood? That's
a new house rule? Fine, I don't
mind, cuz I'm a

The cheerleaders -- Buffy, Senior Cheerleader and the rest practice. Buffy has a big, happy grin on her face, she's workin' this cheer -- unfortunately she's workin' it completely out of sync with everyone else.

Buffy stomps on the Senior Cheerleader's foot.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Ow! Get it together, Buffy, we have
a game in less than four hours.
ANGLE - DOOR

Willow and Xander slip in to watch.

BUFFY
(yells)
Hey Willow, Xander! My buds are
here. I love my buds.
WILLOW AND XANDER

React to Buffy.

XANDER
Is it me, or is Buffy somewhat
looped?
Each girl launches the one next to her into a spinning cartwheel. Buffy is launched.

WILLOW AND XANDER

WILLOW
We better get her out of there.
XANDER
Yeah, before she...

Buffy cartwheels to the Senior Cheerleader, grabs her and HURLS HER OUT OF FRAME like a flying sack of potatoes.

WILLOW AND XANDER WINCE

XANDER
....hurts somebody.
ANGLE - SENIOR CHEERLEADER

Splatted in the corner of the gym where she landed. She gets up, way more angry than hurt.

BUFFY
Did I do that?
SENIOR CHEERLEADER
You are so out of here!

Willow and Xander rush in, grab Buffy.

WILLOW
It's not her fault --
XANDER
She's on medication --

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Obviously not enough. Who's our
next alternate -- oh.

Amy is right there, in costume.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Amy, you just made cheerleader.
BUFFY
No no no, you don't want her, she's
a wi--

Xander clamps a hand over Buffy's mouth as Willow and he hustle her out.

XANDER
A wise choice indeed.
As Amy stands, innocently joins the line,

CUT TO:
INT. GYM FOYER: DAY

Willow and Xander drag Buffy out, shut the door.

BUFFY
She's a witchy!!
WILLOW
Buffy --

BUFFY
I just got kicked off the team,
didn't I?

XANDER
I don't think it's your fault.

BUFFY
I know you don't. That's cause
you're my friend. You're my
Xander-shaped friend.
(wells up)
...do you have any idea why I love
you so, Xander?

WILLOW
We gotta get you to --

XANDER
Let her speak!

BUFFY
I'll tell you. You're not like
other guys at all...

XANDER
Well...

BUFFY
You are completely and totally one
of the girls. I'm that comfy with
you.

Willow can't help but look a little pleased; Xander looks like he just got cancer.

XANDER
That's great.
BUFFY
Any other guy gave me a bracelet,
they'd want to date me, it'd be a
thing, but you -- you --

She staggers a bit.

BUFFY
Oh. I don't feel so good.
She slumps over, pale and sweaty.

WILLOW
Buffy?
BUFFY
Something is really... not good...

She collapses in their arms.

CUT TO:
INT. THE LIBRARY - GILES' OFFICE - DAY

Buffy's laid out in two easy chairs. A cold compress on her head. She's conscious but very sick. Giles (ever present text in hand) Willow and Xander stand over her, concerned.

WILLOW
We gotta get her to a hospital.
GILES
They can't help her. This is a
Bloodstone Vengeance Spell, hits
the body hard, like drinking a
quart of alcohol, then eradicates
the immune system.

XANDER
Vengeance spell. Like she's getting
even with Buffy?

BUFFY
(weak)
'Cause she knows I know she's a
witch.

GILES
The others she just wanted out of
the running, you she intends to...

BUFFY
Kill.

WILLOW
How much time do we have?

GILES
I'm sure we have --

BUFFY
Truth please.

GILES
Couple of hours, three at most.

XANDER
So how do we reverse Buffy's spell?

GILES
I've been researching that. We can
reverse all the spells if we can
get our hands on Amy's spell
book --

WILLOW
And if we can't get our hands on
it?

GILES
The only other way is to cut the
witch's head off.

XANDER
(raising his hand)
Show of hands...

BUFFY
No. It's not Amy's fault. She
became a witch to survive her
mother.

XANDER
I don't care why, I care that you
go on breathing.

BUFFY
Giles, where would she be casting
these spells?

GILES
She needs a sacred space with a
pentagram, a large pot...

BUFFY
At home. Help me get up.
(Giles helps her up)
We'll go to her house, find her
book --

WILLOW
We'll go with you.

BUFFY
No. Stay here, keep an eye on Amy.

GILES
And keep her away from the science
lab. We'll need it to cast our
counter spells.

CUT TO:
EXT. AMY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Giles pulls up.

ANGLE: THE DOOR

He knocks loudly. Buffy peeks in the window by the door.

ANGLE: THROUGH THE WINDOW - AMY'S LIVING ROOM

We see Catherine start at the sound of knocking. She takes something we can't see very well and slides it under the coffee table. Comes anxiously to the door.

It opens, and she stands before Buffy and Giles. It's clear from the expression on Buffy's face that this isn't what she was expecting.

CATHERINE
What do you want? Is there
something wrong?
GILES
Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to
you about your daughter.

CATHERINE
I'm not allowed to -- you'll have
to come back.

she tries to shut the door -- he pushes it open rather forcefully. He ushers Buffy in.

CUT TO:
INT. AMY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Giles moves Buffy to the couch, turns to Catherine.

GILES
Your daughter is up to something
very dangerous. Are you aware of
that?
CATHERINE
I don't know what you're talking
about.

GILES
I think you know very well.

CATHERINE
You have to go. She's gonna be
home soon.

GILES
This girl is very sick. You will
shut up and you will listen to me.
You daughter has access to some
very powerful magics. Somehow
your obsession with cheerleading has
made her --

CATHERINE
(near tears)
I don't care about cheerleading!
It's not my fault she's doing
stuff.

Buff is staring intently at Catherine.

GILES
As her mother, you should accept
some responsibility for her
actions.
Surprisingly, she starts laughing.

CATHERINE
Well, these kids today...
Buffy looks at her, then looks at what Amy hid under the table.

ANGLE: UNDER THE TABLE

is a plate of brownies.

Buffy stands, weakly.

CATHERINE
She's out of her mind. Ever since
control her.
GILES
You're afraid of her.

She turns to look at Buffy, who approaches her slowly. Giles turns as well.

BUFFY
Amy?
Catherine takes a step back, wide eyed.

BUFFY
Are you Amy?
GILES
I don't understand...

BUFFY
She switched, didn't she? She
switched your bodies. She wanted
to relive her glory days.
Catherine the Great.

GILES
Good lord...

Catherine nods, quietly.

CATHERINE
She said I was wasting my youth...
So she took it.
BLACK OUT.
END OF ACT THREE
Act Four
INT. AMY'S LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Catherine has sat down on the couch next to Buffy. She is terrified and fighting back tears.


CATHERINE
I didn't know about her... her
power. When my dad was here they
would fight, he called her a witch.
I thought he meant something else.
When he left I wanted to go with
him but she wouldn't even let me
call. She got crazy. She'd lock
herself upstairs for days. And
she'd get down on me all the time.
She said I didn't deserve to have
it so easy, that I didn't know how
hard it was to be her. I guess she
showed me, huh?
She does cry now, quietly. It takes all of Buffy's effort to say:

BUFFY
Amy, it's gonna be okay.
CATHERINE
A few months ago I woke up in her
bed, I didn't know where I was...
and I looked in the mirror...

GILES
She locked herself upstairs.
Where?

CATHERINE
She has a room in the attic.

GILES
Show me.

CUT TO:
INT. AMY'S ATTIC - A BIT LATER

We see the dolls lined up in the foreground as in the background the DOOR BURSTS OPEN, Giles coming in behind it.

Catherine stays in the doorway, too afraid to enter as Giles comes up to the dolls.

CATHERINE
If she finds out I've been in here
she'll kill me.
GILES
My God...

ANGLE: TWO DOLLS

A woman and a girl. The dolls are lashed together with a thorny vine.

GILES
I believe we can reverse your
mother's spell. All of them, in
fact.
CATHERINE
You really could?

GILES
Yes, but I need her books. There
are certain volumes she would need
for this kind of casting.

He looks around. Tentatively, she enters, and helps. They rummage about in the dark recesses of the place, looking on shelves, under old blankets.

Giles discovers a small trunk. As he pulls it open he says to Catherine:

GILES
Collect those dolls, and all the
personal --
something LEAPS at him from the trunk, SCREECHING -- a black cat. Giles jumps back as the cat hits the floor and takes off out of the room.

Giles takes a moment to recover himself.

GILES
Nice kitty...
(looking in the trunk)
What were you guarding? Yes...
He pulls out the book.

GILES
This is it.
INT. AMY'S LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Giles comes back down with the book, Catherine with the box of talismans.

Buffy is back on the couch. She looks ghastly, but she looks up to Giles with hope.

BUFFY
Did we find?
GILES
We found.

He gently helps her to her feet. He hands the book to Catherine and picks Buffy up.

CATHERINE
Where are you going?
GILES
We're going to school. And you're
coming with us.

CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - EVENING

We hear students CHEERING as the school basketball team takes the floor.

The camera is in steady motion, following the team, sweeping across the stands, racing by the cheerleaders. The last one is Amy.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - EVENING

They enter, Giles placing Buffy in a chair as Catherine drops the box on a table. He squats before Buffy, looks her in the eyes.

GILES
I'm going to stop this.
ANGLE: BUFFY'S POV

the figure of Giles is a colorful BLUR. The room seems to teeter and shift around him, his VOICE a bizarre and deep echo.

GILES
I promise. Just hang on.
He stands up (we are no longer in her POV), digs in the box for the book.

CATHERINE
How is she?
GILES
We only have a few minutes.

Giles pulls the book out of the box, starts looking through it.

GILES
Let's see... I'll need lead,
sulphur, some sort of diacetate...
He goes over to the glass cabinet with the chemicals in it. It's locked. Casually, still looking down at the book for reference, he picks up a metal beaker and smashes the glass. He looks in and starts picking out vials of useful substances.

CATHERINE
What should I do?
He turns to her.

GILES
Find me a frog.
CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

The game has started, the kids in the stands CHEERING. The cheerleaders are on the sideline, doing steps.

ANGLE: AMY

Is right there with them, last on the left. She is beaming.

ANGLE: THE CROWD - AMY'S POV

They are a ROARING mass, an appreciative audience. A joyful noise.

And she moves in SLOW MOTION, the camera circling LOW around her, as she relives her greatest glory.

ANGLE: THE STANDS

The camera whips across the fans to find Xander and Willow up off to the side.

They alone are silent, their eyes never leaving Amy.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - A BIT LATER

Giles has something bubbling in a beaker, a Bunsen burner under it.

Catherine is nearby, reluctantly prying out a dead frog's eyes.

GILES
Right.
He throws in a powder, and begins:

GILES
(reading)
The center is dark.
(in Latin)
centrum est obscurus.
(reading)
The darkness breathes.
(in Latin)
tenebrae respiratis.
(reading)
The listener hears.
He throws in another powder.

GILES
Hear me.
CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

Amy is still strutting in step, still basking in her glory.

ANGLE: AMY'S POV

The appreciative crowd is before us, and then suddenly it becomes

ANGLE: CATHERINE'S POV

the lab. A table. A frog.

It's just a flash, and then it's the audience again. Amy starts, wide eyed, and nearly messes up.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Catherine is reeling just as Amy was, shaking off the momentary change.

CATHERINE
It's working...
GILES
(reading)
Unlock the gate, let the darkness
shine. Cover us with holy fear.
Show me.

He barks the order again, "show me", but this time in Arabic (waar re-nee).

The lights in the room blow out.

CUT TO:
INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

The cheerleaders are forming a pyramid, Amy at the top. She is up there when:

ANGLE: CATHERINE'S POV

flashes before us again. This time it's clearer; we can see Giles, and the whole room. Our gaze sweeps over to include the dying Buffy.

Amy SCREAMS -- and falls, wrecking the whole pyramid. The girls tumble about, the fans LAUGHING a bit.

SENIOR CHEERLEADER
Amy, what's your problem?
Amy stands, primal fury on her face. The cheerleader backs off.

 

Amy RUNS out of the gym.

ANGLE: XANDER AND WILLOW

They see her go.

WILLOW
She must be heading for Buffy!
XANDER
Come on.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE: BUFFY'S POV

Giles continues the spell, in Buffy's increasingly weird, dark view. His voice is not even human to her anymore.

ANGLE: CATHERINE

She is still reeling from the flashes. She looks up suddenly.

CATHERINE
She's heading this way.
CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL HALL - CONTINUOUS

Amy turns a corner and runs smack into a very casual Willow.

WILLOW
Amy!
AMY
Get out of my way!

WILLOW
Wait! I needed to talk to you. I
can help you.

The look Amy gives her raises one's hair.

AMY
Help me? With what?
WILLOW
Well, you know, all your...
witchcraft. I know a really
good... cauldron... do you actually
ride a broom or --

Xander is sneaking up behind Amy. She SPINS suddenly and glares at him. She mutters something under her breath and he stops, suddenly unable to breathe. Drops to his knees.

WILLOW
Xander!
Amy turns and PUNCHES Willow, knocks her to the ground.

Amy takes off.

CUT TO:
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Things are really heating up in here. Giles holds his hands to the heavens:

GILES
Corsheth, and Gilail, the gate is
closed. Receive the dark, release
the unworthy... Take of mine
energy and be sated!
He PLUNGES HIS HANDS into the brew! Huge colored cloud shoots up.

INTERCUT WITH:
INT. HALL OUTSIDE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Amy arrives, tries the door.

Catherine sees the door rattle, startles back in terror

ANGLE: AMY

Smashes the emergency glass and pulls out an axe.

ANGLE: GILES

Pulls his dripping hands out.

GILES
Be sated! Release the unworthy!
ANGLE: THE AXE

hits the door, burying itself above the lock.

ANGLE: GILES

GILES
Release!
ANGLE: BUFFY

Her eyes flutter shut, her head slumping over.

GILES
Release!
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

And the door BURSTS OPEN, An axe wielding Amy running in. She takes one quick look around, heads for Buffy --

GILES
RELEASE!
Amy raises the axe -- there is a flash of light --
--and she stops. Lowers it as

ANGLE: BUFFY

stands, completely restored. She and Amy look at each other in wonder.

BUFFY
Amy?
And Catherine FLIES into frame, SCREAMING and tackling Buffy. The woman has gone completely apeshit. Giles comes at her and she just LOOKS up at him --

-- and a desk MOVES at him, knocking him down.

Catherine stands, comes toward the cowering Amy. Nothing but hate in her gaze.

CATHERINE
You. You little brat.
AMY
Mom, please...

She is retreating, raising the axe more for protection than anything else. Catherine merely cocks her head and the axe FLIES out of Amy's hand and into her own. Amy stifles a scream.

CATHERINE
Raise a hand to your own mother?
Who gave you birth, who gave up her
life, her LIFE so you could drag
your worthless carcass around and
call it living?
She SLAMS the axe into a table top.

Amy looks from the axe to her mother.

ANGLE: CATHERINE'S HANDS

Something is happening -- energy begins emanating from them -- like sparks, only black. Something very powerful is brewing in her.

CATHERINE
You were never anything but
trouble. I'll put you where you'll
never make trouble again.
Buffy appears right behind Catherine.

BUFFY
Hey, guess what?
Catherine turns.

BUFFY
I feel better.
ANGLE: Catherine flies over a table, hits the ground with all attendant smashing of glass things.

Buffy comes around the table and Catherine pops back up, wired with fury.

CATHERINE
That body was mine! Mine!
BUFFY
Oh, grow up.

Catherine throws her head back in a mystical shriek --- and Buffy is flung back over the teacher's desk. She rises to see Catherine shaking, about to cast the spell.

CATHERINE
I shall look upon my enemy --
Her arms CRACKLE with energy -- she opens her eyes and they are glowing darkly- she throws her arms forward with the final phrase --

CATHERINE
-- I shall look upon her and the
dark place will have her soul!
Corsheth! Take her!
And Buffy SWINGS her leg over the table and BREAKS the support for the mirror above -- it comes down, hitting the table at an angle, still supported on the other side.

It's too late for Catherine to stop. The spell shoots out of her arms at her own reflection. It bounces right back at her.

She SCREAMS. Glows. Energy singing around her, wrapping her up.

Then there's nothing.

Giles, no longer pinned, gets up, creeps forward with Amy. Buffy comes from behind the desk. They all look around them, but they are alone. After a while...

GILES
Well, that was interesting.
BUFFY
Are you guys okay?

AMY
(feelingly)
I'm fine.

Buffy smiles at her.

GILES
I think all the spells were
reversed. Of course, it's my first
casting, I may have got it wrong.
BUFFY
You save my life. You were a god.

GILES
One doesn't want to be immodest,
but I am not unsatisfied --

BUFFY
Giles, stop being so proper.
You're in America. Brag.

And they head for the door, Giles obliging:

GILES
Well, it was the first time and some of
those incantations are quite
tricky. And I was somewhat
interpretive with the
ingredients --
A FIGURE LEAPS OUT at Amy, tackles her.

It's Xander.

XANDER
I got her! I got her! Cut her
head off!
BUFFY
Xander, what are you doing?

XANDER
Saving you.

Buffy pulls him off Amy.

XANDER
But she's evil!
GILES
Well, it wasn't exactly her.

AMY
It was my mom.

XANDER
Oh.

It takes a moment for him to realize he has no idea what they're talking about. Willow runs in now, carrying a baseball bat.

WILLOW
Where is she?
XANDER
Willow! It's cool.

WILLOW
It is?

XANDER
Oh yeah. I took care of it.

CUT TO:
INT. BUFFY'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Buffy is throwing pieces of her alarm clock in the trash when Joyce enters.

JOYCE
I don't get it.
BUFFY
What?

JOYCE
I've been thinking a lot about
where you're coming from, how to
relate to you, and I've come to a
simple conclusion. I don't get it.
What you want, what you're
thinking. Not a clue.

BUFFY
I'm inscrutable, huh?

JOYCE
You're sixteen. I think there's a
biological imperative whereby I
can't understand you because I'm
not sixteen.

BUFFY
Do you ever wish you could be?
Sixteen again?

JOYCE
There's a frightful notion. Go
through all that again.
(shudders)
No even if it helped me understand
you.

Buffy kisses her on the cheek --

BUFFY
I love you, mom.
-- and exit, leaving Joyce thrown once more.

JOYCE
I don't get it.
CUT TO:
INT. HALL BY THE GYM - DAY (DAYS LATER)

Buffy and Amy are walking through the hall.

AMY
Dad is so impossible. He doesn't
ever want me going anywhere, wants
to spend total quality time
together.
I'm like, "Dad, I can go out, it's
perfectly safe." He's got all this
guilt at leaving me with mom and
he's being a total pain.
BUFFY
You're loving it.

AMY
Every single minute.

Cordelia breezes by with the other cheerleaders as they get out of the gym. We see Amber and Lishanne -- all recovered.

CORDELIA
Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got
bumped back to alternate. Hold
it -- wait -- no I'm not.
AMY
Well, I know I'll miss the
intellectual thrill of spelling
words out with my arms.

CORDELIA
Ooh, these grapes are sour.

She exits, passing Buffy, who is staring at the trophy case. Amy looks to her, the smile leaving her face.

AMY
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you
actually wanted to be on the squad.
BUFFY
No, that's okay. Cheerleading is
just a little too hairy these days.

AMY
That's for sure.

For a moment they both look at Catherine's trophy.

AMY
Catherine the Great.
BUFFY
And there's been no sign of her?

AMY
That last spell, she said I'd never
make trouble again. Wherever she
is, I don't think we have to worry.

BUFFY
Twisted.

AMY
I'm just happy to have my body
back.
(as they walk off)
I'm thinking of getting fat.

BUFFY
Well, that look is in for spring.

As they leave, we stay on the trophy. TRACK in closer to the cheerleading figure on top. And closer, to the impassive bronze face.

Her eyes dart back and forth.

BLACK OUT.
END OF SHOW
